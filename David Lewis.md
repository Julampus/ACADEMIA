**Are We Free to Break the Law**
See [[DavidLewis-AreWeFreeToBreakTheLaws.pdf]]

Discusses soft [[Determinism]]: the doctrine that, though we are limited by the laws of history and physics, we still have agency in our choices
->
Confirms that, if a choice was made that was not predetermined, then it would likely be breaking some law (an unbroken thing, broken; a contradiction)
A condradiction... unless you accept his *Strong Thesis*

*Weak Thesis* - "I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law would be broken"
*Strong Thesis* - I am able to break a law
A response, in some manner, to [[Peter Van Inwagen]]

Seems heavily contrived, though basically argues that if a law-breaking event, a supposed *divergence miracle*, occurs that breaks some law and allows for a person to do an action they otherwise would not have done, then the person doing such an action would not be breaking a law but would have still willed this action. I don't by it, as it is still dependent on the fact that this miracle occurs
