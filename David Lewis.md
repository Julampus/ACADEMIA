**Are We Free to Break the Law**
See [[DavidLewis-AreWeFreeToBreakTheLaws.pdf]]

Discusses soft [[Determinism]]: the doctrine that, though we are limited by the laws of history and physics, we still have agency in our choices
->
Confirms that, if a choice was made that was not predetermined, then it would likely be breaking some law (an unbroken thing, broken; a contradiction)
A condradiction... unless you accept his *Strong Thesis*

*Weak Thesis* - "I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law would be broken"
*Strong Thesis* - I am able to break a law
A response, in some manner, to [[Peter Van Inwagen]]
