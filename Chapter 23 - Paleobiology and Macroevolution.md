#### 23.1 - The Fossil Record
Fossil records are stored in *strata* (or layers) of rock. Every fossil in the same strata was present at roughly the same time. 
*Radiometric Dating*, comparing the levels of carbon isotopes (C14 and C12) with their half lives
#### 23.2 - Earth History
What the globe has looked like has changed over years of continental drift, according to the theory of *plate tectonics*
This changed where organisms lived, and thus, where their fossils were found
Random natural events (volcanos, asteroids, etc.) also cause mass extinctions or otherwise change organism behavior and earth history
#### 23.3 - Historical Biogeography and Convergent Biotas
Two types of organismal distribution:
	*Continuous Distribution*: organisms occupy a continuous, uninterrupted, and consistent pattern of distribution
	**Disjunct Distribution**: organisms occupy distinct, disjunct, and spotted patterns of distribution
		Usually a result of *dispersion* - when organisms move away from an original population to a new population (organismal) - and *vicariance* - when habitats fragment (environmental)

Biotas - the collection of all organisms within a given region (fauna, flora, bacteria, etc.)
Biogeographical realms defined by differences in biotas
Continuities in biotas demonstrate 11 historical **zoogeographical realms**

Nearctic
Panamanian
Neotropical
Palearctic
Saharo-Arabian
Afrotropical
Sino-Japanese
Oriental
Madagascan
Oceanian
Australian

*Endemic species* are those that occur nowhere else on earth other than in their habitats
#### 23.4 - The History of Biodiversity
Adaptive radiation occurs when organisms that are closely related develop different [[Adaption]]s
	E.g. [[Geospiza]]
	These organisms occupy generally different *adaptive zones*
