## The Mountain
From [[Exile and Pride - The Mountain.pdf]]

The Mountain (or even The Climb) as a metaphor for ascending social and economic rank and class. The climb is incredibly arduous and not made with everyone in mind. Those on top make the pathway difficult. Many stop climbing on the way, some die on the climb.
The pursuit is both to be at the top and the pursuit of *overcoming*
"Piss on Pity" -> "I am not asking for pitty. I am telling you about disability"
	People often misinterpret information with what is to be pitied, or even what is to be interpreted as inspiring

With mountains, a failure to climb is a physical one, while with tests, the failure is socially imposed
The story of the disabled person overcoming odds is mostly tokenism and doesn't seek in any way to address how ableist our society is structured to be

Disability is an interaction between impairment and desire (to do something) - to 

Disability and achievement are set up to contradict each other in the eyes of an able bodies society

"I never once heard, "You made the right choice when you turned around." The mountain just won't let go." -> After deciding to turn back when climbing a physical mountain for their own safety, the author is only considered as an overcomer

"How could I possibly call my body home without the bodies of trees that repeatedly provided me refuge? Without queer bodies? Without crip bodies? Without transgender and transsexual bodies? Without the history of disabled people who worked as freaks in the freak show, displaying their bodies: Charles Stratton posed as General Tom Thumb, Hiram and Barney Davis billed as the "Wild Men from Borneo"? The answer is simple. I couldn't."
It is a matter of the "Body as Home" -> a very similar sentiment to [[Between the World and Me]], in which the body is under threat, is vulnerable, fragile

"Let's turn around here. This one is too steep, too slippery for my feet." -> We must build ourselves a world where we don't need to prove that our bodies aren't less that others'
When taken in consideration with [[Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens]], emphasizes the intersectionality and indivisibility of identity
## Freaks and Queers
From [[Exile and Pride - Freaks and Queers.pdf]]

The words that are used to describe disabled people do not exist in isolation, but have actual history and pertinence to their lived experiences
	E.g. *handicapped* - disabled people could only get money in growing cities by putting their outstretched cap out for cash

Are disabled people disabled because of their bodies, or because of the world around them

*Freak Shows* constructed of:
	Disabled people that were made to appear as otherly and monstruous
	People of colour made to appear as "savages" and cannibals
	Native Americans were exoticized
	People with physical differences that weren't disabilities
		E.g. Hiram and Barney Davis - two brothers with dwarfism that acted as "Wild Men" - said to be from Pacific Islands, actually sold by their Mother from Ohio
		Or women taken from Africa with piercings labeled as Savages
Audience members were also exploited, pickpocketed, and given incorrect change
Actors were also exploited, many of whom had mental disabilities

Sometimes people found communities in the *Freak Shows*, other times they were abused or murdered

Mentally disabled people were said to be reflections of "unevolved" humans
These ideas of ability and race were inextricably intertwined

In the 1990's, the "Couple in the Cage" (in which two people dressed as Native "noble savages" from a lost island in the Gulf of Mexico) stood outside of history museums and exhibits and charged for photos
	Unfortunately, crowds believed them
	Not a relic of the past

Why doesn't the word *freak* have the same connection that *queer* does to the LGBTQ community, if this history is, in a way, reclaimed
	Freak shows aren't over, they just look different
	E.g. public medical stripping of disabled children for medical study and "education" as late as the 90's
	Separate and unequal education still occurred until the 90's

Reclamation of language requires stepping through all of the history and personal experience of the world
