## JULAMPUS' BARNARD TEXTBOOK

I pay too much in tuition just to let all this hot, juicy knowledge go to me.

Note: The markdown files are best read in Obsidian! This is because many of the notes reference eachother, and Obsidian automatically creates links to the specified files listed in double brackets.
Notes are catagorized by class year and class subject. Vocabulary is often put into a folder titled "SUBJECTLexicon." 

Seminar and language-learning classes are more difficult to accurately document, though efforts have been made to include main points, readings, and various other miscellany picked up from these classes. Feel free to DM me with suggestions or questions, as I want to make this archive as useful to others as it can be!

Eat up, my loves. Enjoy the fruits of my education, and prosper.
