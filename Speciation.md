The process by which a new [[Species]] results from another, preestablished species

Speciation split into:
*Allopatric* - as a result of different environments
	e.g. the Isthmus of Panama cutting off populations of butterfly fish, islands separating from the mainland, founder effects in parts of an environment changed by natural disaster, etc.
	Species hybrids form as speciation gradually occurs (so long as the genotypes aren't too distinct and there aren't too many isolating mechanisms)
		Post-zygotic isolation mechanisms begin to develop first before [[Natural Selection]] selects pre-zygotic isolation mechanisms
	*Secondary contact* can occur, in which a species that has been allopatrically separated from an initial population returns to the original environment as a new, distinct species
**Sympatric** - resulting from the same environment
	Happen through mutations that affect behavior (e.g. diet), development, and genetics (e.g. polyploidy)
