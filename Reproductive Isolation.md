Reproductive isolating mechanisms - genetic and physical traits that prevents the creation of *hybrid* and keeps species distinct - split into two categories
	*Pre-zygotic isolation* (before/during fertilization)
		ecological - reproductive isolation due to locational/environmental factors
		temporal - reproductive isolation due to different mating/reproductive times
		behavioral - reproductive isolation due to communication or other behavioral factors
		mechanical - reproductive isolation due to physical/morphological incompatibilities
		gametic - reproductive isolation due to molecular incompatibilities in gametes
	*Post-zygotic isolation* (after fertilization)
		hybrid inviability - hybrid embryo death due to developmental issues
		hybrid sterility - when the resulting hybrid is unable to produce viable gametes
		hybrid breakdown - a hybrid is able to be produced, but its subsequent offspring have drastically increased levels of viability
