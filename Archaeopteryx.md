Earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx, emerged 150 million years ago
	Feathers first evolved (presumably) as being selected for temperature retention and sexual selection, then gliding, and then flight over millions of years. 
	We have a transitional fossil of them that still have beaks, bipedal structure, and feathers, though no flight function like with most modern birds.
