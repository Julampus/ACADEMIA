**Are We Free to Break the Law**
See [[DavidLewis-AreWeFreeToBreakTheLaws.pdf]]

Discusses soft [[Determinism]]: the doctrine that, though we are limited by the laws of history and physics, we still have agency in our choices
->
Confirms that, if a choice was made that was not predetermined, then it would likely be breaking some law (an unbroken thing, broken; a contradiction)
A contradiction... unless you accept his *Strong Thesis*

*Weak Thesis/Law-breaking ability* - "I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law would be broken"
*Strong Thesis/Law-breaking ability* - I am able to break a law
A response, in some manner, to [[Peter van Inwagen]]

Seems heavily contrived, though basically argues that if a law-breaking event, a supposed *divergence miracle*, occurs that breaks some law and allows for a person to do an action they otherwise would not have done, then the person doing such an action would not be breaking a law but would have still willed this action. I don't by it, as it is still dependent on the fact that this miracle occurs

"Two ways to break a window: directly break it or do something indirectly such that the window would be broken"

[[Free Will]]

*Local Miracle [[Compatibilist]]*
	Local miracles break laws and allow you to do something other than what is caused
	If 
	Individuals have the weak sense of law-breaking ability -> people have the ability to do otherwise that what laws dictate, they are just determined not to break the law *unless* there is a local divergence miracle
	We have the ability to indirectly cause law-breaking divergence miracles, though divergence miracles supply us with the ability to act differently

No miracle actually happens in our world, it is just a relative term to describe other possible worlds with different laws

## Thought Cabinet
How can one observe a *divergence miracle*... wouldn't we be able to see this occurring

Before the divergence miracle, were all possible timelines following the same laws

Relies that alternate worlds are possible
	The phrase "could have" is doing a lot of heavy lifting...
