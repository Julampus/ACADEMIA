*The Imitation Game*
In order to answer the question: ==Can machines think?==
Originally a game in which there are three players: A) a man, B) a woman, and C) an interrogator. It is the interrogator's goal to find out which player is the man and which player is the woman. The man and woman's goal is for the interrogator to make the wrong guess. All communications happen in separate rooms and are conveyed via. teleprinter "In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator"

This can be applied to determining whether or not someone is human or machine.

The question of "can machines think" is now replaced by "can machines mimic (and be potentially indistinguishable from) human communication"

Digital computers split into three parts:
	i. **Store** - computer memory in which information is "stored"
	ii. *Executive unit* - carries out operations to perform calculations (what tools are at the robot's disposal)
	iii. ***Control*** - making sure the machine follows the proper rules of the imitation game by encoding instructions

Would a machine that uses random chance have "free will?"
	Choices depending on decimals of pi, near indistinguishable from free will (though difficult to say that it is)

*Discrete state systems* make it so that intermediate states (oft. between 1 & 0) are rounded or ignored...
	Can be related to Laplace's view of the universe as a whole as a system, one which all future states of the system can be predicted by just a single snapshot of the instantaneous state
		Issues arise as minor displacements and errors in calculations at the quantum level can lead to drastically different outputs and predictions on the macro-scale
No such thing as a "discrete state," according to Turing, as everything exists on some sort of continuum

Digital computers can supposedly mimic any discrete state machine (e.g. one based on an input state of a lever pull and rotational degree of a turning wheel)

Giving the digital computer a high enough storage could supposedly give it a universality property (as outlined by Laplace) required to perform well at the Game

Addresses some of the arguments against the potentiality of the machine winning the game:
	*Theological argument*: "Machines (like animals) are incapable of having souls like humans"
		Turing argues that this would imply a serious limitation of the omnipotence of god. If he simply wasn't able to allow for other beings to have souls, then there would be a restriction on his capabilities
		There is a supposed arbitrary border imposed on his powers
Concedes the existence of souls
	*Mathematical argument*: there exist physical limitations to computer storage that would impede a computer from mimicking a human
	These same limitations might apply to the human intellect, turing proposes
	*Argument from Consciousness*: machines cannot create art or feel as we do...
	Doesn't necessarily need to be convered
	*Arguments from Various Disabilities*:
	"Well machines can't do X or Y"
	Merely an issue with induction; we haven't seen machines do X or Y <u>Yet</u>
	*Argument of Individual Creation*
	"Machines cannot originate their own creation, but can only do so from prompts and human engineering"
	Must think future-forward... also, machines often create unexpected outcomes (don't always align with the creator's intentions)...
	*Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System*
	"The human body is a continuous, indiscrete system which the machine will never be"
	Yes, but it can come indistinguishably close thanks to repeated probabilities to replicate intermediate states
## Thought Cabinet
Do humans have infinite "store" space 
	Or even merely the potential for such?

"The original question, 'Can machines think?' I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion"
