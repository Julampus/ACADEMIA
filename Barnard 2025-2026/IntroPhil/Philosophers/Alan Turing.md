*The Imitation Game*
In order to answer the question: ==Can machines think?==
Originally a game in which there are three players: A) a man, B) a woman, and C) an interrogator. It is the interrogator's goal to find out which player is the man and which player is the woman. The man and woman's goal is for the interrogator to make the wrong guess. All communications happen in separate rooms and are conveyed via. teleprinter "In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator"

This can be applied to determining whether or not someone is human or machine.

The question of "can machines think" is now replaced by "can machines mimic (and be potentially indistinguishable from) human communication"

Digital computers split into three parts:
	i. **Store** - computer memory in which information is "stored"
	ii. *Executive unit* - carries out operations to perform calculations (what tools are at the robot's disposal)
	iii. ***Control*** - making sure the machine follows the proper rules of the imitation game by encoding instructions

Would a machine that uses random chance have "free will?"
	Choices depending on decimals of pi, near indistinguishable from free will (though difficult to say that it is)

## Thought Cabinet
Do humans have infinite "store" space 
	Or even merely the potential for such?
