Also from *Ionia*
An old man, living to nearly 90, allegedly, and well traveled

A contemporary of [[Pythagoras]]
   
A teacher of [[Parmenides]]
	Both wrote in verse

Was against the traditional notion that the gods were of human form and took on human characteristic, as was illustrated by [[Hesiod]] and [[Homer]]
	Rather, he likely believed that there "is no god but the world"
	Though parsing through what Xenophanes meant is difficult due to the fact that he often contradicted himself (at one instance stating there is only one god, while at others implying there being multiple gods (and worlds))

He recognized the timely nature of things, that all returns to earth and comes from earth, and water as both a life giving and destructive force
	Believed that water would eventually consume the earth -> taken in part from [[Thales]]' [[Arche]]

Preferred public funding going to the arts rather than to athletics - definitely very involved in the observable and critical of conjecture

"If oxen or horses had gods, they would depict then as oxen-gods or horse-gods" -> god would necessarily be fundamental -> potentially a depiction of an *infinite* apeiron God (see [[Anaximander]], after all, he did attend a lecture of his)

Gave redditor energy
A man full of contradictions though highly motivated by the empirical
	Notably, both that there exists many worlds and only one world, and that things are both infinite and finite. That both what-is and what-is-not are true and existant
