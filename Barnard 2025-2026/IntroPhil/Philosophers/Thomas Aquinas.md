Argued that, though we cannot fully comprehend God's infinity through his finite effects, the very existence of his effects prove his own existence. In *Summa theologiae*

Somewhat of a cosmological argument for God

God is the moving principle, as you cannot be mover and moved

The first efficient cause must be God (as everything in the universe is observed to be causal)

Made an argument in [[Cosmology]]
	The first mover argument, causality and the first mover/cause
	An "unmoved" first mover must be God
