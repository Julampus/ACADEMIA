From [[Thales and Anaximander.pdf]] - Part of the "[[Pre-Socratic Philosophers]]"
¶¶ 1, 3, 6–7, 9–11

Taught by and pupil to [[Thales]] - also from Miletus in Ionia
All his principles reflected on by later philosophers

The cosmos/"first principle" ([[Arche]])) originates from **apeiron** (the infinite/boundless) 
	As opposed to *water*, which was proposed by [[Thales]]
Additionally, everything is in eternal motion (pretty accurate) - there exist multiple worlds

But what moves is eventually unmoved, undone
	A framework outlined of a cosmic balance, or [[Justice]]

"The earth is not supported by anything" - in a sort of misty sphere with vents that open and close to let in fire-light that look like stars.

The infinite must be a principle, as if it had a start point then it wouldn't be infinite

Animals come from moisture enclosed in bark - the moisture takes a different form (a common theme of forms and the formless)
	Humans born from fish (proto-[[Evolution]]) of a different kind (not so much)
	Humans come from the sea, in heated water, kept inside embryos and birthed out of the water (An idea likely inspired at least in part by his teacher)

***Hot*** and *Cold* come from the **apeiron** and create ==ordered== change in the world

Could supposedly predict earthquakes...
