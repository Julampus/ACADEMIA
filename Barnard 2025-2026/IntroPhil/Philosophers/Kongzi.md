Wrote [[Analects]]

Supposedly a record of ***[[Kongzi]]*** (Kongfuzi -> "Confucius" - 511-479 BCE)'s Teachings - **The Master** acts as a stand-in for Kongzi
	*Fuzi* -> gendered honorific to men and male teachers DONT CALL DING THIS
	*Kong* -> family name
*Analects* (Lunyu - discuss and select) -> Means "collected sayings"

The golden age of Humanity (according to Kongzi) - strangely the rhetoric that fascists use (returning to a golden age)
May not be a coherent whole -> may be read in parts
happened in the Western **Zhou** period (1045-711 BCE - bit of a time gap - Referred to sometimes as the Former Kings
	Zhou rules had a special relationship to "*Heaven*" (天)
	To achieve this special relationship, they performed [[Rites (Li)]] (禮)
		Etiquette to ceremonies
	The Zhou rules received 命, a *mandate* to rule over China using 德, or *[[Virtue]]*.
	The *Rú* 儒 (Erudites/Confucians) cultural specialists preserved the rites - listen to them and you'll be able to return to this golden age
	Leading others to follow the Dào 道, “*[[Way (Dao)]]*,” to [[Heaven (Tian)]]
	The *[[Gentleman (Junzi)]]* (君子)  were those who had "intuitive mastery" of the cultural forms expressed in the Li, and had thus possesed supreme virtue of [[Goodness]] *Rén* 仁 (Goodness)
		What a perfectly realized person has
	Once the way becomes second nature in a virtuous, good person, there are in a state of *wúwéi* 無為, or effortless action
		Harmony with the Way of Heaven
		Once virtue, goodness, and wuwei have been attained, the world will begin to "effortless[ly] order" itself to crown a ruler according to the heavenly bodies.
*Filial piety* - combination of the characters "old" and "sun" (with "sun" carrying "old" on its shoulders) 
	More than just obeying, theres also the relational aspect
