Born of *Ephesus*, part of the *Ionian* tradition as a naturalistic monist

The divine law, [[Logos]]. controls the cosmos
"Understanding how all things form a unity is a fundamental part of the necessary insight" 
	Heraclitus was critical of those who received a formal education but did not come to understand and internalize the world around them, similar to Kongzi in the [[Analects]] being critical of those who did not *learn* the [[Way (Dao)]]
The cosmos, his [[Arche]] are described to be of ***Fire***, in contrast to [[Thales]]' flowing water and [[Anaximander]]'s infinite formlessness

According to [[Logos]], all things are one
Right thinking means understanding and following the [[Logos]], being wise enough to act in accordance with it
	As such, placed a great emphasis on not just education, but right thinking
		As an ethical imperative

Coined a theory of "unity of opposites"
	That the combination of two opposites creates a new form
		Of sea being both foul and fresh water
		The straight and crooked path are one in the same
		Age and youth
		either identical... or opposites of a spectrum... maybe a theory of spectra?
		"Good and ill are one" -> A theory [[Augustine of Hippo]] would use in an attempt to combat the problem of evil

"Upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow... It is not possible to step twice into the same river. . . . It scatters and again comes together, and approaches and recedes" (38,39) - In reference to the [[Logos]], things are always in motion, and so the meaning of action is in <u>constant flux</u>

Things are cyclical [[Soul]]s (of fire) => Water => Earth => Water => Souls (of fire) => ....

Referred to as the Riddler, as his explanations tended to be.... lackluster
