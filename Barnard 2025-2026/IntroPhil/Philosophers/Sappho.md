Poet (using naturalistic imagery)
The finest thing on earth is what one loves ([[Eros]]) - "Helen" supposedly the most beautiful of all mortal women...
Love coming from queen **Aphrodite**, goddess of love
[[Eros]] - the "loosener of limbs"

"For you beautiful women my mind never changes."
"A handsome man is good to look at, but a good man will be handsome as well." - **Beauty** is *[[Goodness]]*
"Sweet mother, I cannot weave – slender Aphrodite has overcome me with longing for a girl."
"Wealth without [[Virtue]] makes a dangerous neighbor, while their blend holds the pinnacle of happiness."

*On rejection/heartache:*
	The feeling of wanting to die is present (just as it is from the thought of unreciprocated feelings, or of holding love within you and not sharing it)
	(a) but you have forgotten me (b) or you love someone else more than me

Marriage as praise-worthy
