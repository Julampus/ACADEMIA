A pupil of [[Parmenides]] and (potentially briefly) a follower of [[Pythagoras]]
Wrote in verse, as did Parmenides

Known broadly for being a miracle healer and a physician, having said to have reverse aging and deter plagues from cities. 

Empedocles' [[Arche]] was a fourfold-theory of "roots" -> later incorporated into the Italian School of Medicine which he fathered (According to [[Galen]]) and again affirming his roots as a Pythagorean due to his reinterpretation of *harmonia*
***The Four Roots***
	Earth
	*Water*
	***Fire*** (special emphasis was placed here (especially in reference to the soul); an idea likely expounded upon from [[Heraclitus]])
	==Air== (as physical rather than the ethereal *aer* that [[Anaximenes]] spoke on)
The four roots are balanced by an eternal tug-of-war between **Love** and [Strife] -> shaping the infinite universe over infinite time

Extended to medicine with four different qualities (privations and additions of their respective counterparts) -> Later influencing the Theory of [[Humours]] (shoutout Katie)
	Heat
	Cold
	Dryness
	Dampness

Perpetrated the idea of *concioussness* being centered in the heart -> though developed a more robust theory of respiration that included both pulmonary and epidermal pore interactions

Supposedly the inventor of **rhetoric** (a counterpart to [[Zeno of Elea]]'s invention of *dialectic*)

Believed that pursuing knowledge would free the soul from the cycle of rebirth (reflecting the southeast Asian traditional view of [[Samsara]] - though differing in the method of freeing ([[Karma]] vs. Knowledge) 
	Foundational to the later [[Plato]]nic emphasis of knowledge over the physical, and of the physical world being deceptive while the world of [[Form (Plato)]] being more fundemental
	Allegedly threw himself into Mount Etna to convince others that he had ascended to [[Heaven (Tian)]] without dying... a gold slipper of his was allegedly found at the lip of the volcano
