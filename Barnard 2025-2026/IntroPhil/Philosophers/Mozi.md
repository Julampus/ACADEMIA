From [[Mozi.pdf]]
*Mo Di*, the guy who wrote the Mozi, founded the Mohist School (Moija, 墨家) - 100 years later than the [[Analects]]
### Main Text
#### Chapter II
Formatted as... "our teacher Mozi says..."
E.g. of *impartial care* - "For one would do for others as one would do for oneself."
	Treating those a round you as family
	Benefits don't come from hate, but love and care
[[Impartiality]], then, seems to be the more loving version of the [[Gentleman (Junzi)]], the person who acts with [[Virtue]] for all (not just for the heavens)
Contradicts the impartial person to the partial person
Discusses condemning [[Impartiality]] in word but not "in deed" (*in vivo*)
#### Chapter XVII - A Condemnation of Aggressive War
[[Gentleman (Junzi)]] ought to condemn attacking neighboring states just as much as thievery and murder (praise what is right and condemn what is wrong)
#### Chapter XXVI - Heaven's Will
[[Heaven (Tian)]] knows if you have committed an offense... we must then leave it to heaven to admonish those sinners and treat those around us as family
"If I do what Heaven desires, then Heaven will do what I desire"
.
.
.
"how do I know that Heaven desires what is right and dislikes what is not right?"
	Right brings good fortune
	Wrong brings calamity (presumably a reaction from [[Heaven (Tian)]])
[[Heaven (Tian)]] is hierarchical... Counselors -> Son of Heaven -> Heaven
Heaven cares about all impartially and accepts offerings from all impartially
#### Chapter XXXV - A Condemnation of Fatalism
[[Fatalism]] (A Confucian idea) argued as a way to interfere with the work of the people - discourages tangible progress
One must use **three gauges** to find out if claims of [[Fatalism]] are true:
	*Precedent* - What has already happened from the sage-kings (Zhou dynasty?) (more in line with tradition)
	*Evidence* - What the people have already seen
	*Application* - Science! Make a prediction, see how it plays out
#### Chapter XXXIX - Against Confucianism
The lives and mourning periods outlined in rituals is assigned arbitrarily (or at least incorrectly), according to Mo Di
	The Confucian is still looking for the person after they die in following these rituals
Fatalism means that striving for [[Goodness]] would be impossible, and so there is a contradiction between the Confucian mandates received from Heaven and what a gentleman must pursue
Listen to music and embellish their rituals with food and drink(argues that Confucians are "missing the point" of the rituals)
The clothes and way of speaking are out of fashion, we should always be striving for the new (good) thing
A [[Gentleman (Junzi)]] shouldn't only "make a sound when struck" (like a bell), but should make comments when both the good and the bad happen
Don't focus on proving other people wrong, but letting people know about *impartiality*
 "What foulness, perversity, deceit, and hypocrisy is there greater than this!"
### Thought Cabinet
Notably *anti-aristocratic*, a line that Kongzi was to afraid to draw in the [[Analects]] - even critiqued confucian tradition
	"Mozi could tax his followers, judge, and punish them; under certain circumstances he could even put them to death." 
Rather than a wishy-washy hierarchy from Kongzi involving the [[Gentleman (Junzi)]], Mozi reinterprets the Ren (goodness) as "**Benevolence**"
	Striving to maximize:
		Wealth
		Order
		Population
Rather than familial love, urged for "universal love" or "*impartial care*" (jiān’ài, 兼愛)
Says "and now I have shown that this is the case... but he hasn't" ing another state (under any circumstances) is a great wrong (and an even greater wrong than murder and thievery)
Chapter 39 is where Mo Di gets sassy - diss track against Kongzi laid out in parts
"[The confucians] show voracious desire for food and drink but are lazy when it comes to doing their work"
Significantly more systematic (or at least clearer as to their evidence/credibility) than Kongzi
Concerned moreso about [[Pragmatic]] searches for truth
