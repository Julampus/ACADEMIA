Teacher to [[Plato]] 

Featured in [[Republic]]

"Inventor of the Socratic Method"
	Intense interrogation leading one to realize that one's initial view isn't so tenable after all
	*Philosophy as "midwifery"*
		Knowledge is already within, the potential
		[[Logos]], BUT truth is a recollection (from a past life)
	The end goal being to make you think and doubt what you believe (opposite of [[Philosophy As an Antidote to Injustice]] with philosophy being constructive)
