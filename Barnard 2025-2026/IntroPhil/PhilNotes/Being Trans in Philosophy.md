Being trans in philosophy means putting up with being
	Invisible
	Villainized
	Harassed
	Ignored
	Belittled
	Put against harder circumstances
	Feared/Threatened
	The "transgender issue" arises - your voice is not at the table

"Philosophy as a discipline should
abandon the many ways it has coddled transphobic philosophers and
equalize the role of gadfly rather than create a one-sided trial
that trans people can never satisfy." - Amy Marvin

"There is a spectre haunting philosophy. It is the spectre of
trans people." - Maximiliana Rifkin

The reality is that trans philosophers have a harder time publishing our small scholarly contributions than anti-trans philosophers have shaping the legal and health systems that are currently being used to make our lives unlivable"

## Thought Cabinet
Nietchzean idea of the overman -> Surpassing and finding identity as a trans woman?

Any advice in pursuing the field other than bracing myself? 
Sappho - general rejection of the homosexual in philosophy
Satre - history of sexuality

Philosophy as constructive - Morton - comes up most in this case...

Similar to [[Logos]] and the [[Way (Dao)]]... transition is such a process. There isn't an end goal. Pass? Maybe... but how can you reconcile with your past in a society that doesn't accept you... Must be constructive, I suppose.

As Camus in The Myth of Sisyphus -> Gender is absurd, there's a disparity between how we feel and how we are (with anyone! that's dysphoria. Gender fulfills the pursuit.)
