*in which are demonstrated the existence of God and the distinction between the human soul and the body*

#### First Meditation
*What can be called into doubt*

What cannot be doubted?
	Struck by him being wrong about his beliefs consistently
	==Sense== ==data==

Doubting makes you seem almost like a madman, but how can you possibly know you're not?

Can disprove everything he thinks he knows, as that would take an eternity, so instead targets his foundational beliefs

Like, what if this was all, like, like a dream bro... bro

Even if what is on the canvas might be depicting something fake, the colors (fundamental parts) may still be real
	The *fundamental truths*

The evil demon deceives with sense data, to spite the demon: you doubt
	Being put into a *skeptical scenario* (e.g. the matrix, when reality and perception don't line up)
Maybe its easier to just submit to the illusion...
#### Three levels of Cartesian Doubt

| Level of Doubt | Reason for Doubt                                   | Scope of Doubt                                                            |     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 1st            | The senses sometimes deceive us                    | I can't be certain of beliefs acquired through senses                     |     |
| 2nd            | Being awake and being asleep are indistinguishable | I can't be certain of pretty much anything other than mathematical truths |     |
| 3rd            | I could be deceived by an evil demon               | Can I be certain of anything?                                             |     |

## Thought Cabinet
We will always be limited in what we see by our bodies... we are always in a *skeptical scenario* 
Beauty in sensations...
And yet, maybe Moreso, there exists a beauty in the real

How do you know that the evil demon didn't give you the wrong [[Logic]]
