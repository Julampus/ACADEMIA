By *[[Ibn Sina]]*

**The Proof of the Necessarily Existent**
Existence can be
	*Necessary* or (mathematical [[Truth]]s)
	*Contigent* (not necessarily a [[Truth]] in all sense)

There must be a finite number of things existing

That Possibly Existents Cannot Be Causes of One Another in a Circular Fashion at One and the Same Time If They Are Finite
