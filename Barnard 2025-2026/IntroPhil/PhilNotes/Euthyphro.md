## Main Text
Presumable, [[Socrates]] can see the future
*Maletus* is indicting him for impiety
	For communing with the [[Daimon]]
**Euthyphro** is prosecuting his father (a murderer of murderers) and supposedly has knowledge of the gods will.
	Socrates uses his method, being annoying and asking questions - atheistic
[[Socrates]] hopes to discover the [[Form (Plato)]] of piety
If what gods like is *pious*, and what they don't like, **impious**, then pray tell, what if the gods disagree - THEN you have to concede that something can be both pious and impious at the same time  
Gods and men argue
"It's because it's loved that it's a loved thing" - points out Euthyphro's cyclical reasoning of calling what's pious what's loved by the gods, and what's loved by the gods, what is pious 

**Euthyphro's Dilemma** - an issue on piety (or framed differently as [[Goodness]])
	X is good
	X is loved by the gods 
		Which is dependent on the other?
	Usually taken as an argument against [[Divine Command Theory]]

*Euphyro* then runs away after realizing his reasoning is cyclical
