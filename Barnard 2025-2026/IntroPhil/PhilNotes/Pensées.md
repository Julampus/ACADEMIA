Written by [[Blaise Pascal]]

## Main Text
People cannot prove the existence of God, as there is no knowing the extent or limits of God
People know there exists infinity, but not its limits because it is outside our finite range

Because the existence of God is unknown, one should ask themselves whether or not they *should* believe in God

Always take the coin flip when the infinite is to be won and the finite is to be lost

## Thought Cabinet
What about an inverse god
Or infinite gods
Or pragmatic vs reasonable god
Omnibenevolent god

Is he trying to convince philosophers or masses
