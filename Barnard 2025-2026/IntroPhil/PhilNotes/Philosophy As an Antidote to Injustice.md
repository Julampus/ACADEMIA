"what could philosophy do for you?" (103)
	*Answers:*
	1. Thinking "more pragmatically" - falls short as merely a means to an end
	2. Exploring capital "T" truths - falls short in the sense that it relies under the (false) premise that philosophical truths are any more valuable than any other one may encounter
		Morton kind of ignores the fact that philosophy can be for everyone in dismissing this answer
	3. "**Philosophy is the antidote to the uncritical acceptance of the world and ourselves as we are**" (104)
		But philosophy is not merely about critiquing ourselves, there must also be a solution
		"**Philosophy must aim at a remedy**" (106)
		Both critical AND constructive

Descartes (Especially in his First Meditations) is not taught only to provoke skepticism and unnerve the reader, but to spark curiosity, promote logical thinking and premise analysis, and help people *imagine a way in which the world might be different*

Plato prompts us to *pursue truths that may have otherwise lain dormant or hidden from plain sight* in his Allegory of the Cave discussed in his [[Republic]]

Morton discusses an activity in which paper fish (representing the proliferation of life) are distributed equally amongst groups, prompting ethical and moral dilemmas that, again, prompts students to think about ethics, justice, and politics. 
	This game illustrates the concept of the [[State of Nature]]
Morton also touches on their own experience with the concept of the [[Veil of Ignorance]] or the "***Social Contract***" in John Rawls' *Theory of Justice*

Its about "Harnessing the power of the imagination"
It's about refining concepts, having a strong sense of belief and *imagination*

Bertrand Russel Quote:
 *"Dogmatism is an enemy to peace, and*
*an insuperable barrier to democracy. In the*
*present age, at least as much as in former*
*times, it is the greatest of the mental obsta-*
*cles to human happiness."* (109)
