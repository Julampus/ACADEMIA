### A Neoplatonic Quest
A response to the problem of evil: Evil, or badness, is *relative* - God did not create evil as all things God created are good
"Things that are liable to corruption are good"
	Supreme goods are incorruptible
	Bad things cannot be corrupted, as they are already corrupt
	Therefor all things that exist are good - God creates good things
		By extension, evil is not a substance, but instead, something that subtracts good and existence from existents
