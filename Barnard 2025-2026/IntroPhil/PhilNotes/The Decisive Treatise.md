#philosophy 

By *Ibn Rushd [Averroes]* (a lawyer, imam, judge, etc.) in 1126â€“1198
From [[Ibn Rushd.pdf]]

Part of classical Arabic philosophy
(poet, rhetorician, dictator) who supposedly discusses the allegorical meaning of the text as a man of education and is punished for it
Seems in defense of **Abu Hamid**
## Main Text
Is the study of philosophy and logic allowed (or prohibited, or commanded) by the *Law* - the word of God?

**1.** The Law Makes Philosophic Studies Obligatory
	Things must be viewed as [[Teleology]] (namely, of God's design and for his purpose)
	In fact, there is an obligation to discover and understand how things are
	"And logic must be learned from the ancient masters, regardless of the fact that they were not Muslims."
		We ought to learn from those who came before us "regardless of whether this other one shares our religion or not"
	Just as a lawyer seeks to learn more about the nature of the Law of God, so too should the knower of God (The Philosopher) learn as much about the intellectual reasoning and systems God has created
	Science is built upon histories of other intellectuals

Showing devotion to god (comes to assent) through:
	Piety and Demonstration
	Rhetorical Arguments
	Dialectical Arguements

**2.** Philosophy Contains Nothing Opposed to Islam
	Vague scripture are allowed to be understood through allegory
Arguments arise in what should be taken literally, allegorically, or disagreed with even
The interpretation of God's word has changed over time

//

Everything that is brought into existence by something other than itself that is matter is called "**originated**" (fire, water, air, etc.) - while what's brought about by free agents is between these two extremes ^v
	originated and coeval with time, as dubbed by [[Plato]]
What isn't originated is "*pre-eternal*" (e.g. God)
The objects that lie on either ends of these extremes are atemporal, lasting forever (evidence from scripture, of God creating one while the other is there before God...)
	While the objects that lie somewhere in the gradient of originated and pre-eternal (that is, created by man) are timely and temporary

If you take scripture literally, then you cannot admit that God existed alone in the beginning, as that is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Qur'an

If you are right or wrong about interpreting God, you are still rewarded by God, as pursuit of the truth is rewarded either way 

Outlines scriptural error in 2 aspects:
		If you're generally knowledgeable in something, it is excused if you're wrong a little bit in that field
		It is not excused to those who aren't qualified in the subject

You need to know when to interpret things allegorically vs. literally in scripture. Any one in the wrong place is heresy

In texts, there are three types:
	The apparent texts which are to be taken literally (never allegorically)
	There are the apparent texts that are both allegorical and literally by different people
	There are also texts "on which there is doubt"
		Discuss, just don't be an *unbeliever*

==The imams have to ban books about interpretive scripture to those who can't understand it==

**3.** Philosophical Interpretations of Scripture Should Not Be Taught to the Majority. The Law Provides Other Methods of Instructing Them
	"The purpose of Scripture is to teach true theoretical and practical science and right practice and attitudes."

Two parts make up right practice (what brings happiness and avoids misery):
	Outward "bodily acts"
	Acts of the soul

 Now the methods available to men of [arriving at] judgments are three: demonstrative, dialectical, and rhetorical; and the methods of forming concepts are two: either [conceiving] the object itself or [conceiving] a symbol of it.

4 types of methods to make judgements from scripture:
	The literal, verbatim lessons (Q1&2)
	Allegorical texts with certain premises and symbolic conclusions (Q2&3)
	Allegory with certain conclusions and symbolic/up in the air opinions (Q1&Q4)
	Based on opinions and symbolic conclusions (Q3&4)

|                       | Conclusions | Premises |     |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------- | --- |
| Certain               | Q1          | Q2       |     |
| Uncertain/Opinionated | Q3          | Q4       |     |

Very gatekeepy about scripture
	Just as a doctor cannot teach the masses of medicine (and the masses shouldn't see medicine as allegorical but physical and shouldn't critique what they don't know) so too should this logic follow for Imams and philosophers

[[Mu'tazilites]] being dissed for interpreting many things allegorically

Philosophy is the friend of religion

## Thought Cabinet
Does philosophy not conflict with sahri'ah law... law REQUIRES the study of philosophy

Philosophy and theology in conflict

Three types of people, three paths to [assent]  (ranked)
	Demonstrative reasoning (the philosophers; logic)
	Dialectical reasoning - arguments, objections, responses to objections (repeat)
	Rhetorical versions of truth - (relying on faith)

Dual meaning in philisophical texts

What if the types of truths compete (apparent vs. allegorical...)
	DOESN'T HAPPEN according to [[Ibn Rushd]] -> Philosophy uncovers the inner truth
