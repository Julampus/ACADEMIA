On *[[Kongzi]]*
Assigned the selection of books below from [[Kongzi.pdf]]
## Primary Text
### Book One
A dialogue between **The Master**, **Master You**, **Master Zheng**... (the latter two, disciples of Kongzi)
Respecting your elders establish to be a part of the [[Rites (Li)]], finding "roots" in the [[Way (Dao)]]
Respecting those around you, valuing the **relationships** as well as your role in society
As well as those who have passed
What **The Master** seeks "comes to him unbidden" - that is living harmoniously
### Book Two
Following virtue makes you as the north star - use of naturalistic imagery to remind of the [[Way (Dao)]]
Being filial (or of the aspects of a child to your elders) not only means taking care of, but having ***respect*** for those around you
Keeping the *present* and the *past* in harmony - will come to replace *governance*
Teaching the people through [[Virtue]], not through force
### Book Three
The **Ji Family** - powerful, in government
You need to be good and full of [[Virtue]] first before you partake in [[Rites (Li)]]
Music mirrors perfection
### Book Four
Keep yourself around other people who are Good and full of [[Virtue]]
Don't worry about whether you have a title or not. Good will come to the virtuous and those who are in accordance with the [[Way (Dao)]]
Goodness attracts goodness; the [[Gentleman (Junzi)]] strives for this goodness.
	A good being will naturally be inclined towards the good
### Book Five
Not only right speech, but an emphasis on right conduct
“What I do not wish others to do unto me, I also wish not to do unto others.”
### Book Six
When receiving a reward, even if you don't need it, share it with others (6.5)
Exhaust yourself on the path of the [[Way (Dao)]], don't let a mental barrier stop you
Mixing "cultural refinement" and "native substance" - the refined and the natural - beauty and beast - instinct and intention - male and female? - emotive and physical
	Its about balance, fodr the[[Gentleman (Junzi)]]
You can respect the "commoners," just keep them far from you (6.22)
	**Hierarchy** is being established
Wise (joyful) vs. the Good (Long live) - a distinction that may not be to apparent
(6.30) - Outlines how those who are good and follow the [[Rites (Li)]] ought to rule - they are given a mandate by heaven
	In a way, implies that the common simply shouldn't, as they haven't been given a mandate
### Book Seven
You must be able to learn from your mistakes and to **overcome** (A Nietzschean archetype, just, of course, thought up earlier)
Wealth is not worth pursuing, but that which you love, is
The capacity for goodness exists within everyone
### Book Eight
Some authority can be made to have the commoners follow the way, but it's the [[Gentleman (Junzi)]] who can truly understand the [[Way (Dao)]]
Love learning (good introductory reading for the rest of a philosophy career)
"In a state that has the Way, to be poor and of low status is a cause for shame; in a state that is without the Way, to be wealthy and honored is equally a cause for shame.” (8.13)
### Book Nine
Bowing before ascending is ==clearly== better than after - about levels of one's superior. Again an emphasis on **hierarchy** - submission to it
Awaits for the right offer, doesn't act with haste when trying to sell something, but lets the offer come to him for his [[Virtue]]
What barbarians need is a strong, good, and virtuous ruler so that their non-goodness can be (seemingly) corrected
The [[Way (Dao)]] is constant, flowing like a river - and so following it must be a wholly constant endeavor - the [[Gentleman (Junzi)]] is always good, otherwise he is not a gentleman
Live up to what others expect of you
### Book Ten
Only sleep on a straight mattress (presumably one of the [[Rites (Li)]])
### Book Eleven
“You do not yet understand life—how could you possibly understand death?” (11.12) 
	Not to ignore the spirits, but to be good in life so that you can honor those who came before you with virtue
The master's teachings vary depending on the person (*the pragmatic one should act with more instinct, and the careless should defer their judgement to others*)
"The point is that true government is effected through the superior Virtue gained by ritual practice"
### Book Twelve
Changing your own actions will have those around you also change (change starts with the *self*)
	E.g. "The Virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, and the Virtue of a petty person is like the grass—when the wind moves over the grass, the grass is sure to bend.” - again, use of **naturalistic imagery**
### Book Thirteen
Not just rote memorization in learning, but actually internalizing knowledge and becoming a new, better person from it
	A prototypical form of [[Dialectic]]/Synthesis
### Book Fourteen
Having something meaningful to say and the courage to say it come naturally to the one who is Virtuous and Good, respectively
### Book Fifteen
“Is it not ‘sympathetic understanding’ (shù 恕)? Do not impose upon others what you yourself do not desire.” - The opposite of the ==Golden Rule==
	The distinction is important, as I believe it lets Kongzi reinforce hierarchy (the virtuous doesn't necessarily need to act good to the common, just not to act poorly)
Everyone has the capacity to be educated, and education on the Good must come from within
### Book Sixteen
Joy from relationships, the rites, and music trumps arrogance, entertainment (a. la. doom scrolling), and lacking morals 
	Another false premise (that joy can be ordered)
Some people are just born into being good and virtuous (and we should respect them the most, supposedly)
	Here we find Kongzi with his disdain for the uneducated and those who do not desire to learn
### Book Seventeen
We all start out as "similar" (a [[Tabula Rasa]]?) before we diverge due to our environments, molded like clay
Mourning should take **3 years** for a deceased parent - includes a diet of only plain rice and wearing rough, hemp clothing
	The [[Gentleman (Junzi)]] has no need for frivolities when he is mourning and finds no joy in them 
	Almost a payment back for (at least) three years of care from the parents - another sign of *respect*
Master said, ==“Women and servants are particularly hard to manage: if you are too familiar with them, they grow insolent, but if you are too distant, they grow resentful.”== -> Banzhao in [[Lessons for Women]] had something to say about this
### Book Eighteen
N/A 
### Book Nineteen
There is a **hierarchy**, even among virtues. It appears as though some ought to be prioritized more highly than others
## Thought Cabinet
Returning to a "golden age" has always been seen as a conservative appeal to a past (that likely wasn't as golden as was being made out)
	And is in fact contrasted with the progressive leftist notion of "revolution" (Think even in Mao's communist Cultural Revolution) millennia later
It does seem like these rituals, the Li, in fact *take* energy and must be performed with intention (at least starting out) before it can become *effortless*. 
	Why does the way of heaven require us to sit one way rather than what might be most comfortable to us in that moment
		A hedonistic life, then, sounds as though you lean into your physical inclinations
Ask yourself what is [[Truth]], what is true
See lines 49-50 for questioning of Kongzi's hierarchy
	It is as though the Master (presumable a stand in for Kongzi) has some sort of disdain for the poor or "common"
		The logic he outlines is that because they are common, they are farther from the good and from heaven, but also because they aren't inherently well off, they don't have time to devote themselves to the [[Rites (Li)]]
**Themes** of the past, of family, of society, of role, of heaven and death, hierarchy, action vs. intent, overcoming, and the ==reverse golden rule==
Thus, Kongzi's ideas rely on the *(potentially false) premises* that there 
	A. Exists a Way of Heaven which has a supposed "right action" that can be attained through Li
	B. A state of effortlessness can only arise through following these rites, and that it is a state that is possible to attain
	C. There was a Zhou golden age which was in fact the peak of humanity and is something we should strive for, now.
	D. The world will be *effortlessly* ordered around the state of perfection, the wuwei
	E.(?) The capacity for goodness exists within everyone
	F. Change in one person leads to change, societally
	G. That joy can be ranked (some joys are better than others) That hedonistic joy is simply worse than the more refined, spiritual joy
Religion vs. Philosophy
	There is a seeming concern with the supernatural -> yet the concepts try to remain grounded in the natural
Not Kongzi's logical structure is more fragmented (as well as lecture notes style), as opposed to [[Mozi]] who was more systemic
Where is the free-will if only Heaven can provide the mandate
Kongzi's general framework for how the world works is structured based off hierarchy. Those who practice the right [[Rites (Li)]], learn the proper way, and follow the [[Way (Dao)]] to [[Heaven (Tian)]] are placed in higher regard (and in higher positions of power, namely the [[Gentleman (Junzi)]]) than the commoners and the poor who, because although they have the potential to exist in accordance with the virtues, merely choose not to, and should thus follow the lead of those who have the righteous mandate from [[Heaven (Tian)]].
This notion of hierarchy is enforced by Kongzi's prioritization of *relationships* between people. Student and mentor, Parent and Child, (man and woman), master and servant, etc. *Respect*, to Kongzi, seemingly means doing what the person who "knows better than you" wants you to do. That is why Kongzi places such emphasis on the old way of performing the rites, because the Zhou dynasty seemed to have more wisdom, lived closer to the good (likely a fantasy of a golden age that never was).
It is not only people who are arranged in a hierarchy, but the rites themselves, as well as the different joys one experiences in life.
