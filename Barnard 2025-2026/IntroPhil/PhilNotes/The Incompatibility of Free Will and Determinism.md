Establishes a definition for [[Determinism]] , and claims that the notion of a deterministic universe is incompatible with Free Will
Briefly: that, given the 'state of the universe' one can determine all subsequent states by following the laws of physics

Distinguishes "laws of physics" (what's followed in his defining of free will; laws defining matter and movement) with "laws of nature" (laws that dictate behavior and interaction of life)
	Note that a claim can be made that is universally applicable in a given moment but but be proven wrong in the future, in which case such a proposition is not a law of nature

Free will is a mater of *coulds*: does man have multiple choices, of which one is selected, or is there simply no *could* at all

In a more formal language:
	S can render [could have rendered] ... false
	where "..." is replaced by the names of the propositions
The "idiomatic form" of the argument


If anyone has the power to render a proposition false (to not choose a possibility) then the proposition is not a law of physics

In a situation where a judge must decide to or not to raise his hand:
A judge, J, is dependent on pasts before he was born that are out of his control. As such, the judge could never have chosen to or not to raise his hand

Discusses the conditional analysis of free will, which says that if an action is chosen, the subject *would* perform such an action... difficult to dispute other than the fact that there 1
