"Instructions in Seven Chapters for a Woman's Ordinary Way of Life in the First Century A.D." - *Ban Zhao*
Written for Ban Zhao's ~~daughters~~ (girls of her family), as she regret that her son was not raised around a "system"
#### I. Humility
Follow the [[Rites (Li)]] of birth
	Placing the infant the right way, announcing the birth, etc.
	"Let a woman modestly yield to others... [put] herself last"
A woman conducts domestic tasks with no complaints
#### II. Husband and Wife
The [[Way (Dao)]]] of husband and life (domestic life) is connected with [[Yin and Yang]], [[Heaven (Tian)]] and Earth
Women obeying is the "natural order" of things
	Girls should also be educated at age *8* and follow the [[Rites (Li)]], just like men (and culturally educated)
#### III. Respect and Caution
Respect ones place in society, caution from leaving it
Women shouldn't be beat, women shouldn't scold
Just as [[Yin and Yang]], men and women should live in conjugal harmony
#### IV. Womanly Qualifications
Women should have:
	Womanly [[Virtue]] - chastity and modesty
	Womanly words - avoiding vulgarities, speak at "appropriate times"
	Womanly bearing - stay clean
	Womanly work - sew (and not gossip)
#### V. Whole-Hearted Devotion
People can't run from [[Heaven (Tian)]], a woman shouldn't run from home, not assemble groups, gossip (in silly laughter???)
#### VI. Implicit Obedience
Women should listen to the parents in-law
	Even if she's wrong
#### VII. Harmony with Younger Brothers- and Sisters-in-law
Listen to the sisters and brothers in law
### Thought Cabinet
Based off the ideas that there exists a relational harmony that [[Heaven (Tian)]] desires, and that it arises from obedience in women and dominance in men
Should strive to live as a perfect form...
One of the first ever arguments for domestic violence and educating women
Two audiences:
	The officials who would canonize the text
	The young girls who would be reading this
Written in Classical Chinese, and so likely only a few people were able to read it and actually translate
The relationship between Daoism and Confucius -> The cosmic consequence and [[Goodness]] (what is able to be controlled versus what is brought upon you; [[Fatalism]])
