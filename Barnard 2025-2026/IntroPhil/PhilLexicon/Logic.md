Divided into:
	**Inductive Logic -** What most conversation builds upon, the expansion of pattern to make guesses about future outcomes
		Some argue that inductive logic isn't sound nor valid, though an appeal to rationality could say that not following induction is irrational
	**Informal Logic** **-** Arguments built upon deduction, premises, and conclusions 
		e.g. [[Syllogism]]
		First described by [[Aristotle]]... outlining the 256 types of argument structures built upon the universal and particular affirmatives and negatives (All/some of S is/isn't P; of which only 19 are valid)
		*Symbolic logic* followed, representing &, v (or), not, and -> (if ... then ...) which can be summarized by *truth tables*
		Fallacies also come, either relying on false premises or leaps in logic
		Especially helpful in scientific communications
	**Formal Logic -** looks at the types of arguments and whether or not they are valid and sound

Valid logic
	No logical gaps in the connections
Sound logic
	Built upon premises

If *p*, then **q**
	*p* is a sufficient condition for **q**
	**q** is a necessary condition for *p*
