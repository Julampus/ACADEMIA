[[MaimonidesPt1.pdf]], Introduction (up to 1.3b) and [[MaimonidesPt3.pdf]], chaps. 8, 10, 12 (up to 3.20b), 51

Written by [[Maimonides]]
Just as darkness is a lack of light, so too is evil a lack of [[Goodness]]

[[Dualism]]
### Part I:
Written to his student Rabbi Joseph and others trying to interpret Scripture - notably the Tanakh

An idea, similar to what is proposed by [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Ibn Rushd]], of Scripture having multiple meanings
	The metaphorical and the face value
	Doesn't explicitly state what meaning hides within the text, leaves that for the "spiritually mature person" to find out
If there exists confusing or contradictory language, that is a clue that there exists a figurative meaning to the text
	This cures the perplexation

### Part III:
##### - Chapter 8 -
Everything physical that can pass are corrupted only physically
Any form matter takes on is just a prelude to a potential new form - constant motion and shifting
	Corruption is an example of form-changing
Urges are a motion to a corrupted form - necessary evils
	We must resist these urges (sex, indulgence, etc.)
**Minimize bodily impulse** - evils, so a moral reason

The animal form is lowly and pushes evil acts, while the human, thinking form should be used to commune with higher things

In Hebrew, the words for bodily fluids and sexual acts are figurative or otherwise dodge around the topic, an example of this avoidance of impulse and evil in action
##### - Chapter 10 -
Privations, or absences, are themselves not real things. Similar to what [[Augustine of Hippo]] proposed about privations of good as simply evil, a nonphysical "nonexistent" (in the sense of not created) thing
##### - Chapter 12 -
Refutes the claim that, with all good, comes evil, or vice versa
	And the claim that with time, all turns to evil/to good
	"*An evil for every good*"

All the ills afflicting mankind reduce to three kinds:
1. The physical ills from corruption and the world - sickness, natural disaster, disability (apparently)
2. The ills that humans cause to each other (e.g. violence)
3. The ills humans cause to themselves (the excesses, indulgences, etc.)

##### - Chapter 51 -
"Turks to the far north, or Blacks to the far south, and their ilk in our own climes. They are all but dumb animals" - Yikes
*Parable of the City* - there are those outside the city, those within the walls, the gates of the palace, the anterooms, the throne room, and speaking with the King
	Outside are the unreligious and uneducated
	Those with unsound beliefs lie closer in (better than no beliefs, presumably)
	Masses of the Torah followers are within the city (just not in the pallace)
		 ignorant but observant of the mitzvot (God's commandment)
	Those within the palace are jurists
	Those with certainty in belief have reached the ruler
	Moses and his siblings get a kiss from God
		Miriam, the woman, doesn't get a kiss on the mouth because she's a woman. You cannot divorce the bodily needs from the conciousness

The philosophers are those a part of the court, who study theology and find the deeper meaning

Intention matters with praying, not just moving your lips but thinking about what you are saying (similar to Kongzi's notions of [[Rites (Li)]]) - *devotional acts* 

As age comes, so too does wisdom
	There exists ecstasy in death as you approach Him
## Thought Cabinet
In part III, gets VERY critical of people who indulge or are "slaves" to their instincts

Rāzī argues in Ṭibb al-Rū ḥānī, chap. 15, that excessive sexual activity exhausts the body, hastens senility, and harms one’s vision 

Matter is like a "faithless wife" - women always seeks more matter, matter is the corrupting agent

**Reason as the guide to god**

Those who get a "kiss" from God receive [[Providence]], under his care and prevention of evil
	Whereas ordinarily God wouldn't really interfere

The natural evils and moral evils are exceptions to the Problem of Evil, according to Maimonides. 
1. God exists
2. God is all good, all powerful, all knowing
3. No evil God
4. Evil
5. (Maimonides says all are compatible - the esoteric meaning is that **5** itself is a contradiction, showing Maimonides recognizes there is no argument for it)

Religion as a form of social organization - there exists a conflict between faith and reason

Reasons for belief -
	**Epistemic** reasons
		E.g. all my friends say that I Saw the TV Glow is a good movie, lot of reason to believe
	*Pragmatic* reasons
		I will be benefited if I say that I Saw the TV Glow is a good movie (or that God exists)

***Decision Theory*** - calculating what to do, what belief to have, based off of utile-s
