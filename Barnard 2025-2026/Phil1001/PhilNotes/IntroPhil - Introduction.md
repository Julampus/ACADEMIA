#### Calvin and Hobbes - Discussion
"**Why are we here?**"
See [[Truth]], as discussion was laid out here
Astronomy v. Evolutionary Biology v. Anthropology v. History v. Women's and Gender Studies v. Philosophy
	Talking about **scope** and *scale* of the question
	Differences between **purpose** and *determinism*
	Theoretical philosophy vs. practical philosophy
		Identifying the truth vs. what *should* we do
#### On [[Philosophy As an Antidote to Injustice]]
*In approaching the class...*
Philosophy is democratic
	Treating big names as equals
Philosophy is anti-dogmatic
	We believe something because we pursued it ourselves, not because of others
There are *sometimes* wrong answers
	Ask "what's the point," "what are we trying to get out of this," etc.
"What's important depends on what we're trying to do"
