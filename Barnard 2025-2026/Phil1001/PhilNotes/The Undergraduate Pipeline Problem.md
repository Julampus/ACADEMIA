#philosophy 
By *Chesire Calhoun*

Muses about why women aren't going into professional philosophy (or at a rate substantially lower than men)

-> Interest in a lower level philosophy class appears the same between women and men
	The general theory is that something happens (there is some realization, some turn off) during the undergraduate experience that leads to a dramatic decrease in engagement and ==enrollmentin== upper level courses
	71% to 29% split, male to female

Not often blatant sexism (though that does in fact exist) but the fact that women have been conditioned (as a result of gender schemes) to not see themselves as philosophers
	Partly because they don't see themselves in philosophers that are studied
	Partly because faculty usually prop up men in philosophy

What to do?
	Include more feminist theory as a part of philsophy (because it is!)
	Include more women in philosophy department programs
