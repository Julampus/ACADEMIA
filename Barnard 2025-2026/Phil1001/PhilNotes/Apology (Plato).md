*Assigned* 17a–26b and 35e–42a from [[Plato, Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.pdf]]
## Main Text
Interestingly enough, uses the phrase "by Zeus," even as an atheist
What is just and [[Justice]]
"[[Socrates]] makes the weaker argument stronger" - as [[Protagoras]] had done

Mentions how the [[Sophist]]s are allowed to persuade people, but he isn't

An oracle tells Socrates that he is the wisest, he tries to prove the oracle wrong
	"What I don't know, I don't think I know"
	The goal being to find a person wiser than Socrates; the result being that the wise-ness of mortals pales in comparison to that of the gods. Socrates might be being disingenuous here. 

In the presence of 501 people

"Do you think the same holds of horses?"

Isn’t that what you say I corrupt them by teaching?

Receives death penalty
Counter penalty:  "Perhaps I could pay you about a mina of silver. So I propose a fine of that amount." then 10 minas (Ten years salary)

" I say to you men who condemned me to death that as soon as I’m dead vengeance will come upon you, and it will be much harsher, by Zeus, than the vengeance you take in killing me."
