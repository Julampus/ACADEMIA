chaps. 3â€“4

### Chapter III:
*God the Creator of All; and the Goodness of All Creation*

Difficult to uphold, the idea that everything is good and that evil is only a relative disparity of goodness, when starvation, death, etc. exist. 
	Definitely a radical

"Further, the Christian believes that nothing exists save God himself and what comes from him; and he believes that God is triune"

**Evil** defined as the privation of [[Goodness]]

### Chapter IV:
[[The Problem of Evil]]
There exists an *incorruptible entity*, the part of you that cannot be further corrupted

"Bad fruit cannot grow on a good tree nor good fruit on a bad one"
	Evil people will be evil because they are relatively less good, and vice versa with good people
