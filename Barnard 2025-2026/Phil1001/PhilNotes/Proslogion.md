## Proslogion
*By [[Anselm of Canterbury]]*
An argument in [[Ontology]]
#### Chapter 1 - A rousing of the mind to the contemplation of God
The goal is to know God, but how do we do that? How do we know of his face? How do we go about seeking god?
We have been cast out (the fall) and are far from God

An example of reason and faith intermingling:
"For I do not seek to understand in order to believe; I believe in order to understand. For I also believe that "Unless I believe, I shall not understand."

A set up, demonstrating the (seemingly fruitless) pursuit of knowing God
#### Chapter 2 - That God truly exists
An ontological argument for God proposed by Anselm:
God is the thing in which no greater thing can be conceived
Things are greater in reality than in understanding
If God does not exist in reality, then he is not greater, as we can imagine something greater that can exist (at least in understanding)
Therefor, god must exist in reality, as the greatest thing that can be conceived must exist in reality
#### Chapter 3 - That he cannot be thought not to exist
Beings that cannot be thought not to exist (can only be thought to exist) are greater than those that can be thought not to exist.
Therefore the greatest thought (e.g. God) must exist, as if the greatest thought can be thought not to exist, then you can think of a greater thought that can exist
#### Chapter 4 - How the fool said in his heart what cannot be thought
Your heart knows that God cannot not exist
The greatest thing necessarily must exist
#### Chapter 5 - That God is whatever it is better to be than not to be; and that he alone exists through himself, and makes all other things from nothing
Restates his claim
#### Chapter 15 - That God is greater than can be thought
God is not only the best thought, but better than the best thought
## Reply on Behalf of the Fool
*By Gaunilo*
Recaps Anselms argument
"one can seldom or never think of any truth solely on the basis of a word" - one could be lying about the existence of a god and you could still interpret it through "Knowing" of a god

Cannot merely exist in understanding

"How, then, is the fact that this greater being has been proved to be greater than everything else supposed to show me that it exists in actual fact?"
First I must become certain that this greater being truly exists somewhere, and only then will the fact that it is greater than everything else show clearly that it also subsists* in itself.

From the perspective of "the fool," or the non believer

Still believes in god though
## Reply to Gaunilo
*By Anselm*
If, therefore, it can be thought to exist, it does necessarily exist.
There fore, there is no time and no place in which it does not exist as a whole; it exists as a whole always and everywhere.

Distinction between *understanding* and *reality*
"that than which a greater cannot be thought"
Distinction between *thought* and *understanding*
## Thought Cabinet
**Anselm:**
Relies on the premise that there are "greater" and "lesser" thoughts that can be ranked
	And that thoughts in existence and those that cannot be thought not to exist are "greater" than their opposites

Its a matter of *definitions*, as all beautiful things are
Also lies on the assumption that there already exists a "supreme good"

**Gaunilo:**
