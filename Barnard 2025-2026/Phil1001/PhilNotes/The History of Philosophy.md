## Introduction and Appendix
Philosophy divided into:
	Metaphysics
	Epistemology
	Ethics
	Aesthetics
	Logic
	Philosophy of Mind
	Philosophy of Language
	Political Philosophy
	History of Philosophy
	Analytical applications of Philosophy (e.g. of Science, of History, etc...)

Who the philosopher is has changed over the years, though the throughline tends to include "the rational thinker"
	Physics, anatomy, and astrology stem from Philosophy

*Appendix* discusses the fundamental structures of [[Logic]]; see link

## Ancient Philosophy
#### Philosophy Before Plato
Widely lost due to Christian biblioclasm and pagan cultural-evisceration, though later Christian preservation efforts (especially in the case of Humanists) and even early 2nd and 3rd century preservers like Cicero and Plutarch (Contextualized ironically later on by Islamic biblioclasm)
Others of note included Diogenes of Laertius, who compiled brief biographies and stories, including their opera (plural of opus) 
#### The Presocratic Philosophers
Mostly characterized as being Metaphysicists (or simply physicists, at the time) as opposed to [[Socrates]]' later *ethics*

The epicenters of early-Greek philosophy centered in Ionia, Athens, Elea, Croton, Rome, and Alexandria
[[Thales]] of water and stargazing
[[Anaximander]] of apeiron and eternal motion
[[Anaximenes]] of aer and heat
[[Pythagoras]] of harmonia and geometry
[[Xenophanes]] of contradictions and skepticism
[[Heraclitus]] of fire, logos, and riddles
[[Parmenides]] of "what-is" and hexameter
[[Zeno of Elea]] the paradoxical and revolutionary
[[Empedocles]] the physician and rooted
[[Anaxagoras]] of nous and empiricism
[[Leucippus]] & [[Democritus]] - of atoms and age
[[Sophist]]s
	[[Protagoras]]
