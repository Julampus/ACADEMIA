The argument goes like this: "If (so long as there only exists one) God is all good, then why did he create a universe that contains evil. Couldn't he have just... not done that?"
How to reconcile with omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God and evil

Responded to by [[Augustine of Hippo]]

Often a conflict here
1. God exists
2. God is all good, all powerful, all knowing
3. No evil God
4. Evil exists ([[Augustine of Hippo]] argues this is merely a privation of good and that there exists no conflict)
5. ([[Maimonides]] says all are compatible - the esoteric meaning is that **5** itself is a contradiction, showing Maimonides recognizes there is no argument for it)
