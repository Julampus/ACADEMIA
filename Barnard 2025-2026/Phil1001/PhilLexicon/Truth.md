Truth is distinguished between what's:
	*Necessary* - something is true necessarily (or always)
		e.g. 1+1 = 2 (in Euclidian mathematics)
	*Contingent* - something could be true, but maybe in another world....
	(not to be confused with what's universal)
Types of questions:
	between *Fundamental Truths* (meaning of life, "deepest truth")
		There are multiple, lowercase "t" truths
		Have to be *necessary* truths -> a. la. mathematics
	Also the "WTF" types of questions (what's going on, what are we doing here, )

[[Parmenides]] argued that sense experience cannot wholly describe the truth of "what-is"
