### Chapter II - The Existence of Matter
Does matter exist?
Do other minds exist?
Is what we see a reflection of reality or merely an illusion
An extension of [[Ren√© Descartes]]' systematic deduction
	Though expands in questioning whether or not there even exists a continuous *I* that which can think, or if there only exists the mere reception of some sense data

Uses a *dinner table* as a reference point to expound upon the deduction, asking if there is any reason to believe that the reality we perceive is (or even can be) any different form the one that "truly is"

Do there exist *public neutral objects* - objects that everyone shares the same experience when detecting (or at least throughlines beneath the variations across perspectives and perceptions of the world around us?)
Or, a *permanent public object* that is common to all experience (to some degree)
	Assumes that we are situated within the spatiotemporal space once observation occurs
	Also begs the question of whether or not other people exist

Argues that there is no reason to believe that we are in a waking dream of sorts
	Points to nonexistence when an object isn't observed as an error, as continuity between the seeming past object and the new one is apparent  (though potentially constructed)
	We cannot compare reality to dreams because dreams can be traced back to empirical forms (they are dependent on reality, a contingency)
		Couldn't the reality we currently live in now be based of a super-reality (though I suppose that reality would exist to some extend, but we would just be living through the projection of that super-reality)

He believes there must exist an object that is the origin of the sense data

"Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible"

"There can never be any reason for rejecting one *instinctive belief* except that it clashes with others ; thus, if they are found to harmonise, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance."

**Inference to the Best Explanation** (IBE)
	Out of all the explanations, you are justified in selecting the best explanation... (most plausible, as it gives you a good reason, even if all are logically valid) 
Must consider...
	*Parsimony* - the simplest answer is "most likely" to be true, or the best explanation (e.g. Ockham's Razor)
		Simplicity is historically contingent
	*Unity* - does it form a cohesive whole
	*Consistency* - does it avoid contradicting itself
	*Coherence* - with already established theories
	*Explanatory power* - must accurately render the observations predictable/expectable
