early 500-400 BCE "teacher/expert in **wisdom**"
Plato was immensely critical of these sophists in his [[Republic]] - mostly arguing that sophists didn't know what they were talking about, and was critical of the fact that they would teach anyone who had the money (making the *wisdom* less "authentic"?)

Comes from the word *sophia* (like *philosophia*... gatekeeping wisdom from poetry and sophistry)

According to [[Plato]] - public speakers just say things to please the crowd

*Prodicus* was known to supposedly have argued that contradictions don't exist, as if two people disagree, then they are inherently not talking about the same thing and thus there is no contradiction
Tended to be moral and truth based relativists "making the weaker side stronger"

Also tended to be atheistic(?)

Notably, one sophists (Hippias) was reported to have said "How can anyone take laws seriously. It often goes that the people who make the laws end up being the very same people who repeal the laws and make new ones"

Disagreement occurred because truth should not have a price tag on it - or any form of contingency
