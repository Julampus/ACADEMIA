"All men desire to know"
	Through sense data? By sight?
	Knowledge and understanding experience (as opposed to art)
	Sense only tells us what is, not why it is
	Wisdom is knowing what *first* caused things (not merely what is happening, as that doesn't require much reasoning faculty as it does merely noting sense (is it though?))
	Science above the other principles, as it seeks to explain the world (assuming All men desire to know)
		Seeking absolute truths is the realm of the philosophers, the ultimate sciences

The realm of philosophy deals with God, the *first* cause of things
	Interesting that the use of "God" in caps is here (usually a Christian tradition?)
