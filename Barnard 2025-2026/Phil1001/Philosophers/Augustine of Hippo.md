 aka. Saint Augustine or Saint August
*==**Ideas:**==*
God is Supremely Good
Everything that exists is Good
	Because God, the Supremely (infinite) Good, created all things
Evil, then, is the privation (or lack of) good
	Evil is relative, it is not a substance, as if it was created by God, it would be good
Complete corruption, the removal of all goodness and thus, the perceived replacement of evil, is simply nonexistence

Also, "two contraries cannot coexist in a single thing"

Things that are entirely deprived of good are incorruptible (a good trait) = there exists a contradiction
When you run out of good in you, you cannot be called evil (as you cannot be relative to the better things)

## [[Confessions (Augustine)]]

## [[Enchiridion]]

## Thought Cabinet
If total corruption means nonexistence, then scientifically nothing can be evil as matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed (except for in the case of antimatter, but then what does that say about God's goodness)... maybe you can think of every particle as good, and their arrangements different expressions of goodness, and the vacuums or poor formations, evil

Then what is *sin* to [[Augustine of Hippo]]...
	To him, it appears that evil is a way to describe the physical, maybe sin is what describes motion and action; intent.
	It sounds as though a bad person will do bad things and a good person will do good things (have taken on good form), so perhaps a sinful person was destined to sin the whole time

Goodness like filling a glass of water, the empty part of the glass does not exist, only the water
