From [[Protagoras.pdf]] - Part of the "[[Pre-Socratic Philosophers]]"
¶¶ 5–8, 10–12

A [[Sophist]] in the 400 BCE era - Early *Athens*

Expressed agnostic beliefs towards the gods - the limits of human knowledge (similar to the unknowable [[Logos]] or even the [[Way (Dao)]])
==Mathematics== is an *idealized* version of reality that doesn't correlate to any **real** values - "unknowable"

" A person is the measure of all things— of things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not."
	Appears to be touting a form of moral and truth based [[relativism]], in which reality is merely what we make of it (as opposed to the Aristotelian idea that reality is *what is* and we merely provide descriptions of it) -> can be seen as a form of reality-shifting [[Speech Act]]
	Similar to how one individual might think it hot outside while another see it as cold

Outlined a *weak* and **strong** version of an argument - advocated for strengthening the weaker version so that you come to a stronger overall argument

What we know of Protagoras mostly comes from other (quite biased) accounts of him and other Sophists, unfortunately
	Though [[Plato]]'s account of him was likely the most flattering of any [[Sophist]]s that he discussed, depicting him to be a strong and excellent speaker

A doxographer depicted him to be able to argue and win with any side he was presented with (thank [[Zeno of Elea]], if his invention of *dialectics* is to be taken as truth, for this one)

Denied the existence of gods
