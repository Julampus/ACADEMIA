The successor/contemporary to [[Anaximander]]

Proposed that the [[Arche]] was *water vapor* (or **aer**, as opposed to just water like with [[Thales]])
This explanation gave rise to an explanation of the process in which change occurs (that doesn't predicate on the unobservable soul moving principle):
	Heat and cold, rarefaction and condensation, cause motion and change (a cycle between the solid, liquid, and gaseous forms)

Think about blowing soup to cool it down vs. breathing hot breath to warm your hands...

Also built up his cosmological framework (one that [[Aristotle]] borrowed) of the flat earth suspended in air and the sun orbiting around the circumference of the earth
	Did propose clouds to be condensed vapor
