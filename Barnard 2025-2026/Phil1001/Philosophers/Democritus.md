A student of [[Leucippus]]

Another response to the question of the [[Arche]], and one that is an extension of Parmenidean thought. While [[Parmenides]] believed that What-is-not simply doesn't exist, the *atomists* believed that there existed *void* and *matter (atoms)*
	Atoms were fundamental, infinite in number, and eternal
	Change is merely the rearrangement of these atoms
	Atoms differed from one another in their shape, arrangement, and position
Responds to [[Zeno of Elea]] by not requiring things to be infinitely divisible, but instead stopping at the atom, while addressing the source of change and motion (based off the differences between atoms) that were the pitfalls of previous theories of [[Arche]]s by the other *Ionian* philosophers

Supposedly wrote a great number of books (though potentially written by a school he founded under his name), many of which have been lost to time
[[Aristotle]] was critical of this theory, though believed that it was worth studying
	Aristotle offered a more naturalistic, systematic, though non-mechanistic theory of reality and metaphysics
	Most of our understanding of his writings, in fact, comes from Aristotle

A proto-conceptualization of gravity was proposed briefly with the concept of a central *vortex* pulling the heavenly bodies inwards, with heavier bodies being pulled closer in than lighter ones
