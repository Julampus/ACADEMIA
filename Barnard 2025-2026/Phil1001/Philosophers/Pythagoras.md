From *Ionia*

Not much is known of the man himself, but rather our knowledge mostly comes from the cult-like Pythagorean School of thought he left in his wake
The schools ideas mainly centered around:
	*Metempsychosis* - of souls of the deceased existing in other animals
		As such, Pythagoreans were all vegetarians (and avoided eating beans...)
			[[Diogenes Laertius]] reported that, as the Pythagorean School was being chased out by a tyrannical leader in the city of Croton, Pythagoras stopped at a bean field and would not cross due to his reservations. He was eventually caught up to and killed
	*Harmonia* - the balance and consonance of two acoustical tones, applied more broadly to the metaphysical order of things
		A great basis of western music theory can be attributed to the Pythagorean school (Think of the Greek Modes...)
		In fact, a proto-scientific analysis was conducted, with quantifiable ratios of strings assigned to their respective sounds and intervals (Octaves, P5, and P4 were, of course, favored)
		It was not only music, but also the heavenly bodies that were said to exist in tonal intervals of one another (depending on their relative distances)
		An idea that would influence the rest of Greek philosophical tradition
		Would later inspire the [[Humours]]
	*Mathematics* - though not inventing any true ground breaking concepts (only really offering novelty when it came to even identifying the hypotenuse, a concept that can originally be attributed to India) - a. la. the ==Pythagoras' Theorem== (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
		Though this did provide a structural, metaphysical framework of the world, with structures appearing in ratios of each other
		Concepts such as marriage and justice were assigned whole numbers
		Odd numbers were said to be male, even numbers were said to be female
		Numbers themselves were assigned their geometrical equivalents (before the widespread adoption of Arabic Numerals)
			Whole numbers represented by a number of dots, arranged in either triangles, squares, or rectangles depending on what geometrical form they could take on (i.e. 3 = triangular, 4 = square... 8 = rectangular and so on)
		Did not take too kindly to the "discovery" of *irrational numbers*
