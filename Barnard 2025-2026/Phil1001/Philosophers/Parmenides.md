¶¶ 1–2, 7–8, 13, 17–18

From *Elea* (Near modern day Naples) in around *515 BCE*
	A pupil of [[Xenophanes]] - teacher and lover of [[Pederasty]] for [[Zeno of Elea]]
Wrote in verse (Homeric hexameter)

Sense experience doesn't tell the full picture, doesn't describe the whole [[Truth]]

Rejects arguments by [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Heraclitus]] by arguing that understanding can only come from what the *what-is* must be and what the **what-is-not** cannot be (and gives genuine arguments for them)
	You cannot know and understand what-is-not, only what-is
	The *What-Is* must be come to understood through reason, that is how you come upon [[Truth]]
	The senses and data you receive from them can be deceptive and do not wholly capture [The One] (a summation of all of reality)

Reality isn't changing, it is an eternal present (the past and future are **what-is-not**)
	Change states are really just reflections of internal properties that have always been
	*What-Is* is purely the physical, but we can only come to understand it through reason and the mental, as our own senses are deceiving

Rejected [[Xenophanes]]' ideas of things being both what is and what isn't, of change
	Interestingly, still believed in the personified Gods, a departure from [[Xenophanes]]' skepticism 

 First of all gods she contrived Love ([[The Symposium]]... *eros*) 
	 "That the male is conceived in the right part of the uterus has been said by oth- ers of the ancients. For Parmenides says: The goddess brought boys into being on the right side of the uterus, girls on the left."
	 "he seeds of love that come from their veins,"
