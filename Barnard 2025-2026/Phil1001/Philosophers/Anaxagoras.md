Took after [[Anaximenes]] and responded to [[Parmenides]] in many ways

Pushed forward the idea of the *4 roots* as an arche (First proposed by [[Empedocles]]) with his *seeds* (or *panspermia* conceptually identical, though of different characteristics)
	Every trait is inherent to the physical world, merely in proportions 
		There never exists an absence of things
	Traits, or **dynameis** that make up the *seeds* include hot and cold, wet and dry, heavy and light, dense and not, etc...
	Like the concept of love and strife proposed by Empedocles, Anaxagoras believed that the constant ==changing== of things was a result of ***nous*** or the force of *mind* that strings together all things 
		***nous*** is described to be knowing of all things, likely another way of saying that nous is the summation of all knowledge
	Still believed the earth to be flat and suspended in air, like [[Anaximenes]]

Like [[Parmenides]], argued everything is in an infinite cycle, and everything that is is everything that will be (proto-theory of atoms)
	A problem that keeps arising because either
		a) the universe is finite and had a starting point, but then how did things come to existence?
		b) the universe is infinite and eternal, but then how do things appear to change (or be in motion)

Was said to have been able to predict comets

Relied on his observation heavily to come to his deductions, namely that:
	The sun is a hot rock in the sky, while the moon has similar structure to the earth
	Stars are also hot rocks, we just don't feel them because they are farther away than the sun
	Rivers come from rainwater (or melting snow) while oceans come from rivers
	Plants are living creatures, just like animals, and just have a different proportion of *seeds*

Believed in the existence of multiple worlds, an idea reflecting the *Ionian* tradition that he took after (though there is evidence that he traveled to **Athens** as part of an invading Persian army)
