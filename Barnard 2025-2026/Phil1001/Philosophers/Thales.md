From [[Thales and Anaximander.pdf]]  - Part of the "[[Pre-Socratic Philosophers]]"
Thales, ¶¶ 1–5
## The Milesians
Thales and [[Anaximander]] were from Miletus in Ionia (Western Turkey)
Thales was the teacher of [[Anaximander]], though their educational relationship (Sexual-educational relationship featured in [[The Symposium]]?) was reciprocal
Born around *625 BCE* (maybe... only an estimate from [[Apollodorus]])
### Stories Reported from Plato and Aristotle
Thales too busy gazing at the sky (in thought) to notice the earth he was standing on
Classic philosophy cope that philosophers could be rich if they wanted to, but choose not to - read the stars and noted that Olives were in that year, rented all the olive presses in Miletus and then rented them out to their original owners
Early philosophy considered that everything comes from physical matter; *Thales* proposed that everything comes from *water* in one way or another (rather than earth, fire, or air) - water as the [[Arche]]
	In fact, the ***earth*** itself supposedly rested upon *water*
	Likely due to the fact that all life ubiquitously has water, earthen mud would come in during floods of water, water comes from the sky, its in the air, etc.
The [[Soul]] is said to be something "productive of motion" (so thus, magnetism has a soul)
	Containing the **animating principle**
	There must be something that causes motion in the universe
