[[Parmenides]]' pupil, adopted son, and lover

Made about 40 paradoxes, roughly 10 were preserved all about *Motion*
	An extension of the Parmenidean idea of motion and change being an illusion, and the later [[Plato]]nic idea reality and perceived reality are two different things

One paradox of moving across a stadium
	To get to the other side of a stadium, you first must move halfway across the stadium, but then you must move halfway across the other half of the stadium, and halfway again across the remaining half. You can do this an infinitely divisible number of times
	Conclusion: finite motion is an illusion
	Response: our conceptions of modern mathematics (namely, calculus) offer a solution. Namely, that the infinite sum of of 1/n where each increment n increases by 1 and n begins at 2 is 1
Another is of the turtle and Apollo
	If the turtle is given a head start in a race between the two, then Apollo will never be able to win. This is because Apollo must first catch up to the turtle, but at that point the turtle would have already moved ahead. This repeats indefinitely
	Conclusion: finite motion is an illusion
	Response: again, relies upon the premise of an infinitely divisible space, which mathematicians have argued is not indicative of the reality in which we live in.

Though many of his paradoxes can be reasoned out, the very fact that they can be reasoned out demonstrates and pursues a better understanding of the material world that has influenced and inspired many a scientific discovery and forwarding of knowledge

Seemingly a response to the ideas promoted by the School of [[Pythagoras]]... namely that things are divided into whole numbers and their ratios

Supposedly invented the *dialectic* and the concept of *reductio ad absurdum*

A mythology was created around his death (as a politician trying to overthrow the contemporary ruler)
	Sources say in his last breaths he never sold out his accomplices and either bit off parts of his assailants or had a last, witty quip before a brutal end
	This trend of dramatic cult of mythology centering around philosophers continued with [[Socrates]]...
