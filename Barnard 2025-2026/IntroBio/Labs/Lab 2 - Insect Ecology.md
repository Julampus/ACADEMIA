Normal distributions are histogram (visual representations of the distribution of quantitative data) curves that visualize the spread of data, with the tallest bar located at the mean

A *standard deviation* is a deviation from the mean (moving -/+ to it)

Need to examine both mean and variability - taking a *t-test*
	Null hypothesis: there is no significant difference between the means of two sample groups
		Compare the t-value with the critical t-value to see if you reject or accept the null hypothesis
		The farther away from the critical t value, the more confidence you can have in rejection the null hypothesis (as the critical t- value is the idealized t value when the hypothesis is accepted)
**P-value** comes from comparison of t values - the probability of seeing the data you did if the null hypothesis is correct (that's why it needs to be < 5%, so that even when there was no significant difference the probability of you receiving such data is negligible)
	The probability of it occurring (0 to 1)
	reject a null hypothesis if a P-value is â‰¤ 0.05                   

## Building Height Matters: Nesting Activity of Bees and Wasps on Vegetated Roofs
**J. Scott MacIvor**

City buildings have more biocomplexity than some mountainous habitats
Mostly studied in birds, prior, which is what this paper seeks to fix. 
Bees and wasps (specifically cavity-nesting insects) scan up and down trees to look for potential holes... might be reflected in buildings
	There have been papers on how landscape factors and local environments effect green roofs
There was no difference in richness or abundance of bee and wasp species between the different roof vegetation types (intensive, extensive, none) but parasitism rates were highest on intensive vegetated roofs.
At ground level, urban green spaces having more diverse plantings can lead to a greater diversity in bees

Our findings indicate that we can accept our first 
hypothesis that increasing building height results in
decreasing numbers of bees and wasps using in trap nests.
Further, of the eight rooftops not colonized over the three-year study, six were extensive and two were conventional and not vegetated; all were over three building levels in height.
