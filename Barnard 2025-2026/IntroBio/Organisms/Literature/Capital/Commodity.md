A form in which an object takes one under a capitalistic system that is characterized by having both [[Exchange-Value]] and [[Use-Value]].
	Can be thought of as a product which is traded and exchanged in a commerce-based society.
	Or even as a [[Data Structure]] containing both aforementioned properties.
	
An example of a product of labour that is not a commodity can be a shovel made in a communal, societally-focused society. The shovel does in fact have a [[Use-Value]], but its ownership and [[Exchange-Value]] is undefined and thus cannot be a [[Commodity]]
