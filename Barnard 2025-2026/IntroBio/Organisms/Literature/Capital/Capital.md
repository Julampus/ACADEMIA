### Introduction - Ernest Mandel
The context of capital is important when considering Marx's analysis and discussion of *Capitalism*, namely when you consider how industry was structured at the time of his writing: a series of localized, semi-mechanized industries in a "sea of handicraftsmen and agriculturalists"
##### I. The purpose of *Capital*
**A central thesis of *Capital:*** There exist no universalities or laws governing economic processes spanning across all systems of rule.
Furthermore, these economic systems do not exist in isolation and must be analyzed with respect to one another.
Outlines the "*Relativity, Social Determination, and Historical Limitation*" of Capitialism, recognizing that, as it was something that was created, it will be something that will be ultimately replaced.
The Idea of the capitalist mode of production, capital, and wage labor **->** rely on definitions of value, exchange-value, and surplus value, **->** rely on a definition of commodity
Though Marx explains Capitalism historically and describes the modern mode of production, his analysis cannot be directly applied to other versions of societies with *generalized commodities*. 
Furthermore, Capitalism can only be described, as Marx does, within the historical context of value and commodity
The purpose is both to provide a scientific-like foundation and description of Capitalism, as well as to inspire and evoke revolutionary sentiment in the proletariat
##### II. The Method of *Capital*
The way in which **Capital** is enacted is through various "laws of motion" (itself a term reminiscent of scientific discovery)
- Understood through Hegelian *dialectics*, the quantitative and gradual, evolutionary change in economic motion is *contrasted* by the qualitative and spontaneous, revolutionary change in motion.
- Whereas Hegel was an **idealist**, viewing reality as an imperfect expression for a pure version of something (much like Plato's forms), Marx was much more of a **materialist**, rejecting a "perfect form" as a scientific and social impossibility (though still positing a purely theoretical utopia on occasion)
	- Not a capital "T" Truth but a lowercase "t" truth (of which many are implied based upon the context or, in other words, empirical data)
- Though Marx retains Hegel's commitment to "parsing through" assumptions (as is present in modern scientific (both social and empirical) thought) 
Marx's theory rises from the concrete (discussion of commodities) into the abstract (Capitalism)
Marx moreso provides a framework/prediction of where Capitalism was headed in the second half of the 19th century and beyond rather than a comprehensive history of the motions of Capitalism (though he does take history into account when making these predictions)
So far, his predictions (especially the law of value that Capitalism seems to follow), has shown to be prophetic when viewed as a dialectic more than as a scientific method.
	Key Idea: Dialectical logic is in constant reasoning and critique for its thesis to prove correct. 
##### III. The Plan of *Capital*
Marx, as a communist in the mid 1800's, became a journalist for a paper in London (unwelcome at the time, as is the usual British sentiment towards immigrants.) Joined with other economists to formulate a general Communist theory through the publication of a number of texts, including *Capital*
Marx only had direct and total (in the sense of sticking through with it till the end) involvement in the first volume (of which there are four)
Though six volumes were planned, only four were ever completed -> *Is what we have now the final and intended vision of Marx's theory of Capital?*
Though Volume I does deal in more "abstractions" relative to Volume III, it does provide a "purer" basis for a discussion of Capitalism (though I believed him to be a materialist... perhaps a pure abstraction is needed for a concrete analysis)
##### IV. The Plan of Volume I
The commodity = Basic unit of Capitialism
A disparity between actual value brought to an individual and the monetary value evoked and assigned by a money society
- Products now aren't worth what they are worth to the consumer, but what they are worth to the dollar (KEY DISTINCTION)
Capitalist mode of production "not only appropriates surplus-value, [but] creates surplus value"
Through **wage-labor**, capitalists are able to create new **surplus-value** which is assigned to any given commodity, an inherently exploitative and contradictory practice endemic of the **process of production**
Volume 1 defines two types of capital accrued by the capitalists:
1. Constant Capital - the capital used to accrue the resources, land, monopolies, and power, held by the capitalists, which themselves don't produce any profit but help restrict and control the laborers, and then there's...
2.  Variable Capital - the capital used to buy the labor force, controlled by the capitalists, which earns capitalists surplus-value and thus, increases their power
Volume 1 defines two types of surplus-value (profit):
- *Absolute* surplus-value - earned by lengthening the work day to increase the time spent producing surplus value
	- Most prevalent in pre-industrial revolution 
- *Relative* surplus-value - earned by increasing the productivity and efficiency of the laborer without increasing time spent working
	- Most prevalent when following the logic of the industrial revolution
Workers' method of labor remains, even if conditions and efficiency (especially in the production of relative surplus-value increases), so the bourgeoisie gains said value while the worker loses autonomy and individual freedom over their labor 
Machines:
1. Subordinate the workers
2. Produce surplus-value
3. Control the wages of the laborers
Logically then, economics must be defined as a struggle between classes, with the end goal being to reestablish rights for the worker (shorter days, same wages)
Logic of the first Volume I
Commodities -> Exchanged for Money -> Money becoming Capital -> Production of Surplus-Value (from capital, both absolute and relative) -> The exchange of labor power to wages -> The accumulation of Capital (an ouroboros of bills) 
##### V. The Marxist Labor Theory of Value
Marx's Theory of Value (MToV) covers not "through what ways does the economic market (under capitalism) move," but "what mechanisms cause the market to move"
MToV dictates the bounds and patterns by which commodities may oscillate in value as well to what degree resources, both labor and material, are devoted to the production of commodities and the amassing of capital.
	Important to note that value appears to be lost when a profit isn't made, when laborers don't work to their fullest, or when a surplus of commodity isn't fully sold (or sold at a profit).
	Additionally, external factors sway the market that aren't just about scarcity (namely, though bread and planes may be the same in numbers (and thus the same in scarcity), the need/demand for bread will be greater and will bring the monetary value of an individual commodity "unit" of bread down)
	A commodity not socially valuable (opium, bullets, etc.) can find great production value while a lifesaving drug can find none 
(pg.44) The discussion of land privatization... value arbitrarily added to a piece of nature that, socially, has had no value inherent to it (as no valuable labor has been put into it) -> A discussion of "free goods" as opposed to valued "socially necessary quantities of abstract labor" commodities
No *use-value* or *exchange-value* means no *surplus-value*
##### VI. Marx's Key Discovery: His Theory of Surplus-Value
<u>Capitalism</u>
Worker sells labor to the Capitalist (specifically *labor-power* or labor over time)
The Capitalist combines materials, machinery, and the bought labor to create a final product (which he also owns and thus, "naturally," is enabled to profit from)
**One issue:** The worker has no access to the means of production. The owner gets a choice as to whether to make an investment, to buy the labor, or to spend the materials. The worker's only choice is to sell labor for a wage (of which they may not even get to negotiate.) The worker is *"Under Economic Compulsion"*
	Striking is abstaining from selling labor power
Within the past two centuries, the majority of workers have lost access to the means of production (which is why it is important now more than ever to join guilds/unions)
Like vampires, the Capitalists suck up the labor power from the worker and convert it to value

---
"If people are living under conditions where there is no *economic* compulsion to sell their labour-power, then repressive *juridical* and *political* compulsion has to deliver the necessary manpower to the entrepreneurs; otherwise capitalism could not survive under these circumstances"
##### VII. Marx's Theory of Capital
Capital is a product of a social division of labor (a power disparity for those with value and those without value)
	Stems from non-necessary commodities gaining value
	Capital acts almost as a potential energy, separated (in part) from the real world value
##### VIII. Marx's Theory of the Accumulation of Capital
Competition = Relationships between "various capitals" (expanding the sphere of influence)
	If only one trust holding all the worlds capital existed, no growth would occur
Types of Accumulation:
1. 'Simple Reproduction' - Exchanging all surplus-value for luxury goods, maintaining capital
2. 'Enlarged Reproduction' - Allocating at least *some* (if not all) surplus value towards productive resources and thus, producing more capital
The world is an imperial siphon of resources from south to north (from low potential to high potential)

##### IX. Marx's Theory of Wages
Marx pioneers *wage-labor* as another type of commodity factoring into the value of a good under Capitalism, recognizing it as dependent on
1. the *physiological* needs of the worker, and
2. the *historical-moral* needs of the worker
	Explains why wages in more "advanced" (defined by Capitalism) stages are higher than those in "less advanced" stages (morale and *willingness* are higher as quality of life increases) 
The fluctuation of wages is mapped out as a function of the fluctuation of labour-power
"**Accumulation of Capital Wage Theory**"
	Demonstrated in *five* general trends
	1. Accumulation of capital in one class of society results in a decrease in the value of commodity in another class of society (when devaluing the commodity, the worker's labor power is devalued)
	2. + Capital = - value of consumer goods (required for the maintaining of labor power)
	3. Accumulation of capital causes an increase in labor value if the demand for labor is high while the supply of labor only meets the demand (or is in fact lower, as was evident in early industrial America)
	4. If accumulation of capital slows while labour-power value remains high, labour power can be adjusted to regain the + capital (ignoring moral/physiological needs of the laborers)
	5. Also forms an upper limit in which no wages can increase so as to keep the accumulation of capital(see 4.)
Draws distinction between the
	**Value of Labor-Power** - determined by the **value** of consumer goods the laborer is able to buy, and the 
	*Mass of Labor-Power* - determined by the *ammount* of consumer goods the laborer is able to buy
Important to note that Marx argues that as capital accumulates, the position of the worker worsens regardless of whether or not their wages increase or decrease (there is more to value than just the economic)
The value disparity between **skilled** and **unskilled** labour (isn't a circular definition of natural property and the value of work as described by Smith but) can be described as value imparted on from the laborer to a commodity multiplied by a coefficient worth the fractional cost of schooling
##### X.  Marx's Theory of Money
"Money is the necessary generalization of abstract social labor"
	A.K.A. wages cannot immediately be dished out to the worker per hour (often commodities aren't sold in the instant they are created, and the worker doesn't own the commodity they create) and so money is given to the worker as payment for the value they imbued into the commodity
Money itself becomes a commodity
	One that is produced and sold and dependent on the value of the worker and the other commodities it is tied to
	It is a commodity theory of money
If labor is tied to money inherently, than the addition or subtraction of money in circulation directly affects the money value of a commodity
Not only a gold standard, but the direct use of gold as money, as currency, would be a utopian capitalist society, yet would likely give some semblance of ownership of wages and labor back to the worker
##### XI. Capital and the Destiny of Capitalism
Though criticized for being overly prophetic, Marx's predictions and analysis of Capital and Capitalism have proven themselves to be quite an accurate description of Capitalism
The capitalist mode of production is fundamentally defined as:
1. The workers of a given economy not owning the mode of production for which they are producers of (and must sell their labor power)
2. Owners of a mode of production act in constant competition with one another (over resources, laborers, and capital)
3. Owners strive to attain more and more capital (often, if not at all times, extorting the surplus value gained from the worker)
Even with a drastically different looking capitalism compared to the one in Marx's time (with large dragon-piles of wealth being hoarded, multinational corporations spanning the globe, neo imperialism, union suppression, government lobbying (or even oligarchic control)), the laws outlined above hold true
Development of the ***Class Consciousness*** as a median between the dissolution of capitalism and the submission to it (though not discussed here)
Mandel proposes a *Marxist Theory of the Subjective Factor*
	Though there did exist a rise in communism and (more notably) a rejection of capitalism in the early 20th century, what Marx failed to predict was the ironclad influence of
	1. Neo-imperialism bolstering Capitalism, and
	2. The inexperience of the working class mixed with the exploitation by new elite classes
Mandel predicted Capitalism not to survive another fifty years, a sentiment he wrote in 1980. Let's see if Mamdani is the start of something bigger
### Part One: Commodities and Money
#### Chapter 1: The Commodity
Discusses and analyzes the [[Commodity]], a form in which objects take when involved in commerce which specifically contain the attribute of both [[Use-Value]] and [[Exchange-Value]]
It is in these attributes that equivalence, universality, and exchange arise as properties of any given commodity, attributes that tend to fall flat once you dissect how what society values at any one moment is in constant flux and might not equate equally to a "true" or "equal" exchange.

### Prefaces
##### Translator's Preface
Mostly notes on how certain prejudices of words appearing in the first English translation have been taken out and how the imagery and philosophical dialect has been somewhat restored to more accurately reflect Marx's original German
##### The Prefaces and Postfaces- Marx & Engels
Marx mostly addresses changes made between editions of *Capital*, namely in terms of specificity. Marx also provides clarification on his Hegelian dialectics and, notably, where he disagrees with Hegel (especially with the concept of "the Idea" and materialism.)  Marx argues that the process of thinking is only a projection of the real world, whereas Hegel argues the material is actually a shadow of the subject of "the Idea" (Marx acknowledges the anti-bourgeois message this can be interpreted as though disavows its mysticism)
In the preface to the third German edition, Engels discusses the effort of adding revisions to the first volume of *Capital* after Marx's death in **1883**. Engels also discusses (as Marx did) the difficulties in translating and differences between the German and French texts. 

### Glossary
**Capital** - The power inequality (notably: a relationship between two subjects) stemming from value, held by a capitalist, of a given [[Commodity]], service, or property[(?)] 
**Capitalism** - "society in which laborers themselves become commodities" in which the object (often, though not always, over all else) is to accrue capital 
**Commodity** - ~~any sort of good or service traded or exchanged to which a value is assigned~~ *see [[Commodity]]*
**Mode of Production** - The process by which a given commodity is created, often relating to the maker and the resources required to construct a commodity
**Surplus-Value** - the new, additional value assigned to a commodity in a capitalist society (often appearing as "profit")

### Questions
*If assigning a value to a commodity inherently creates a contradiction between its "actual use-value" and the new "monetary-value" assigned to a product, then would a society that simply moves away from this monetary-value towards this use-value function more efficiently (in the sense of having less economic/social disconnect between the subject and the commodity)?*
	As an extension to this question: *Should we strive to construct and live in a society like this?*
*Marx's morals appear to be centered around fulfilling the needs of the individual and of the society in which they live in (while keeping the two in homeostasis). It is not utilitarian in the sense (as ends may not justify means (see class struggle)), so how would one describe such a moral system?*
