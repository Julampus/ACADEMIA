[[Density-Dependent Factors]]
	Density-dependent factors reduce:
		Growth rates
		Adult size
		Survivorship
		Fecundity
	And are *influencing factors that increase or decrease with density of the population*
	And thus regulate *population size*
	Examples of these factors (mostly biotic) include:
		Parasites, predation, competition, etc.
**[[Density-Independent Factors]]**
	E.g. abiotic environmental factors and [[Climate change]]
		Generally limits population size - a [[Population Characteristic]]
		Mostly abiotic
[[Life History]] patterns are divided by:
	r - selected species
		can function in rapidly changing environments
			usually small and short lived
			exhibit [[Semelparity]]
		have high rmax
		influenced by *density-dependent* factors
		higher fecundity over nurturing
	K - selected species
		Might have started out as r - selected
		Exhibit [[Iteroparity]]
		influenced by **density-independent factors**
		larger body size
		higher parental care

[[Metapopulation]]s also play a role in the fluctuation of populations

*Population fluctuations* can appear to be cyclical
	though there don't appear to be models to explain every type of cycle
