"Vegetation type plus its associated microorganisms, fungi, and animals" (1161, [[Chapter 51 - Ecology and the Biosphere]])
	aka. the general type of life in a given are
	traditionally defined for terrestrial environments
**Tropical forests:**
	*Rainforest:*
		> *250 cm* annual rainfall
		Highest humidity
		Highest temperature
		High productivity
		Low light on the surface (absorbed by canopy)
		High [[Productivity (Biology)]]
		Rainforest attributes + winter droughts (dry season)
		Highest density and diversity (due to free energy and)
	*Temperate Tropical Forests:*
		British Columbia... not as dense as regular rainforest
	*Tropical montane forests:*
		"Enveloped in mist," due to high elevation, short trees
	Tend to be around equator
	Nitrogen a limiting factor - always detritivores (due to lack of seasons)
**Savannas:**
	Tall grasslands and scattered trees, often adjacent to tropical deciduous forests
		Can get *150 cm* annual rainfall, but heavy droughts
	Aka. *"Tropical seasonal forest"*
	Periodic fires from drylands spread flora seed and clear tops of grasses for roots to resprout - **succession**
	Animals migrate in seasonal cycles of grasses
	Rapid growth due to high **succession** and [[Productivity (Biology)]]
	*Thorn forests* on the boarders of savanna
		Grows dramatically during rainy season and dries out during dry season
		Less fauna
	Mostly in Africa...
**(Subtropical) Deserts:**
	Less than *25 cm* rainfall annually
	Tend to be at the 30 deg latitude mark 
	Can reach a height of 45-70 degC in morning and below freezing at night
	Rich minerals in soil
	Fast decomposition
	[[Adaption]] caused tighter leaves or photosynthetic trunks
**Chaparral:**
	Short trees and low shrubs
	30 - 40 deg latitude mark
	*25 - 60* *cm* rainfall
	Cool wet winters
	Dry hot summers
	==Think SoCal==
	Fires and drought
**Temperate Grasslands:** 
	Prairies of North America, steppes of Asia
	*25 - 100 cm* rainfall annually
	Risk of fires and drought
	Lots of grazing animals
**Temperate (Seasonal) Deciduous Forests:**
	*75 - 250 cm* annual rainfall
	New England, Eastern Europe...
	Low temperatures and snow in the winter
	Low-middle elevations
	Slow decomposition
		Elm, beech, birch, oak (Minnesota)
**Evergreen Coniferous Forests:**
	*Boreal forest, taiga*
		swamp forest... pine trees
	Lots of snow
		Pines conserve water in winter
	Moose, deer, elk, rodents
	Northern Russia and Canada... Washington state
	Up to *500 cm* rainfall annually
**Tundra** 
	Lowest temperature
	Lowest precipitation (as to Desserts) < *25 cm*
	Treeless plains (or short trees)
	From northernmost Russia and Canada to ice caps
	*500 m* thick ***permafrost*** (topsoil that never cools)
		Releases trapped CO2 due to [[Global Warming]]
	Weak sunlight, 2 months of summer
	*Alpine tundra* found in high mountaintops


often, biomes' temperature and rainfall conditions are depicted by a **climograph**
