From [[Chapter 52 - Population Ecology]]

The *Size* (# of individuals in a population) and *Density* (size per unit of area of [[Habitat]]) can be measured directly/with sampling techniques - determine the resources used (directly proportional, generally)
	Smaller organisms have higher *density*, while the inverse is true for larger organisms
[[Comunity (Biology)]]

In terms of [[Population Dispersion]], organization can be:
	*Clumped* - (in chunks across a habitat)
		most common as
			Good environmental conditions are usually clumped
			Social groups tend to be beneficial
			Reproductive patterns (such as asexuality) or even egg or seed based reproduction have low dispersal
			Mating behavior tends to be the biggest influence on this
	*Uniform* - Spread evenly across, but over a wider area
		Often territory-based - checks 'n balances
	*Random* - Random, yk?
		Unpredictable, distributed independently of each other
Populations also organized by **geographical range**
	The spatial boundaries that the population is limited to
		Boundaries can be changed based on human activity (walking, transferring seeds. etc.)
	Distinct from a [[Habitat]] which are the specific environments in which it lives in
	
**Age structure** determined by
	Relative ages of an organism in each age class
**Generation time** - the time between birth of the organism and the organism giving birth (to make a new generation)
	Short for organisms that are sexually mature when they are small, while the inverse is true for larger organisms
**Sex ratio** - relative proportion of males and females (not always 50/50 :) 
	Females tend to have more weight on the population growth of a species
