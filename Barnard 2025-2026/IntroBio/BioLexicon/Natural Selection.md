Specific traits that give an organism an advantage over others in surviving. The ones better suited to the environment are more likely to live and will then pass along their genes to their offspring

Via. "survival of the fittest" - according to Darwin

Selection can occur in the form of:
	*Directional* selection - shifts mean phenotype towards one end of distribution of genetic variance
	*Stabilizing* selection - favors the mean, variability decreases
	*Disruptive* selection - the mean is heavily unfavored, what is left and right of the mean are increased drastically

Requirements for natural selection to take effect:
	Trait must be at least somewhat heritable or influenced by other heritable traits
	Surviving organisms must reproduce at a different rate
	The trait must be variable

Differences in relative *[[Fitness]]* of individuals are the essence of natural selection

### Constraints of Natural Selection
Not every trait is an adaption
	Jaw size, teeth shape, number of teeth *are* adaptions, chin size *aren't* (they are merely a biproduct)
	Some traits are bi-products
Evolution works with what's available	
	Can't make a trait from scratch
Structures are often co-opted
Developmental constraints matter
	Environmental and developmental influences shape how traits are expressed
Historical constraints shape what's possible
	Evolution is path dependent, there isn't any sort of end point
	"Evolution is not looking 100 years into the future"
Adaptations often involve trade-offs
	Large antlers help in mating BUT are heavy and can get stuck
