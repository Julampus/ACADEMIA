#biology 

A null model depicting what a population that experiences **no** genetic evolution

Can be remembered through the Hand Model:
	(no) Gene flow - middle finger (e.g. moving locations)
	(no) Nonrandom mating - ring finger
	(no) Mutation - thumb
	(no) Small populations, bottle neck, founder effect - pinky (Or other *Genetic drift events*)
	(no) Natural selection - pointer finger

A matter of adding/losing genetic variation
