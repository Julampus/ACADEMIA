From [[Chapter 52 - Population Ecology]]

**Binary fission** - (e.g. bacteria) a doubling of population size
**Exponential growth** - dN/dt = rN
	"J" shaped
	Maximum growth rate is r (sub max) - varies by *generation time*, one of the population's [[Population Characteristic]]
**Logistic Growth Model** - dN/dt = r (sub max) N(K - N)/K
	"S" shaped
	*Carrying capacity* K = max population size
	*Growth rate* r
		Decreases as N (population size) approaches K
		N might oscillate around k
		r can increase due to 
NewN = InitialN x e^(rmax * t)
