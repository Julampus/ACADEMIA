Taken from [[Chapter 51 - Ecology and the Biosphere]]
#### Freshwater Environments
*Salinity below 0.5%* (relative to [[Marine Habitat]]s at >3%)
	Occurs due to rock erosion, minerals released into the water
*Lotic* systems (water flowing) 
	Streams and rivers, riffles, pools, runs, etc.
	***! - Temperature rises as water flows downstream***
		***Higher temperature = less oxygen***
*Lentic* systems (water standing still = generally more vegetation)
	Lakes, swamps, bogs, etc.
	**Light levels** distinguished:
		*Photic zone* - where light penetrates, surface of the lake
		*Aphotic zone* - darker and deeper below the water
	**Trophic (energy) levels:**
	*Oligotrophic* - poor in nutrients and organic matter
	*Eutrophic* - high nutrients and organic matter (soupy)
	**Lake Zonation:**
		*Littoral zone* - shallow water near shore, decomposers and plenty of light + rooted plants (cattails)
		*Limnetic zone* - sunlit water, ==phytoplankton== (nitrogen + light = contribute ==a lot== of oxygen), cyanobacteria (top layer cal led the **epilimnion**)
		*Profundal zone* - no photosynthesis whatsoever (deep water layer called **thermocline**, separates high and low O2 and temperature water)
	Temperature, ice density, and seasonal changes change water currents
		**Spring and Autumn overturn** occurs due to winds vertical currents and uniform temperature (profundal and littoral zones mix)
			Cold water and oxygen go down, nutrients come up
**Wetlands** act as border between [[Freshwater Habitat]] and terrestrial [[Biome]]s

! - Coasts and poles have more nutrients due to terrestrial inputs and ice circulation
