**Ecology** - "the study of interactions between organisms and their environments" (1153, [[Chapter 51 - Ecology and the Biosphere]])
*Basic ecology* deals with where and why species are where they are as well as their relationships with one another and their environments
*Applied ecology* has to do with conservation, amelioration (or mitigating bad things), and repairing ecological damage
Both *biotic* and *abiotic* aspects make up the environment

A *community* is a group of organisms of different species within an area (think microbiome...) 
#### Five General Fields of Ecology
*(increase in scope with number)*
1. Organismal ecology - genetic, biochemical, morphological characteristics of organisms to the abiotic environment
2. Population ecology - **populations** (groups of individual species... changes in size over time... etc.)
3. Community ecology - groups of populations (predation, competition, etc.)
4. Ecosystem ecology - nutrients and the flow of energy between biotic components and their relationship to the abiotic system
5. [[Biosphere]] ecology - see link
Research into ecology is often made with predictions (both theoretical and mathematical) though can be in practically *in vivo*
