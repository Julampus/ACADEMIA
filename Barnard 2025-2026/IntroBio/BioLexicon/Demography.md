From [[Chapter 52 - Population Ecology]]

Study of the *survivorship*, **reproduction**, *immigration* (coming in, + size), and **emigration** (going out, - size (along with death)) patterns that influence [[Population Characteristic]]
	Its trade-offs all the way down, risk vs. reward (potential new food and less predation vs. no mate or different environment)

Tools for analyzing demography:
Both of which divide age groups into **cohorts** - difficult to depict *colonies* as such
	*Life tables show*:
		Age-specific mortality (death over previous)
		Survivorship (remaining over previous, opposite of mortality)
		Age-specific fecundity (measured in seed production)
	*Survivorship curves* show (survivorship):
		High survivorship until late in life - produce few young and provide extended care
		Constant mortality level at all ages - face a constant risk of predation, disease, starvation, etc.
		High juvenile mortality - high offspring production, low survivability

Field work can also be used to measure # of organisms (to take a *census*)
