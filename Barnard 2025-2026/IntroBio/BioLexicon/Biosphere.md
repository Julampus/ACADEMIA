	Biosphere made up of *biotic* (biological components i.e. lifeforms, organisms, whatever you call 'em) and *abiotic* (temperature, environment, etc.) components
	The *abiotic* organisms that make up the **biosphere** are:
	1. The *hydrosphere* (water, ice, rivers, etc.)
	2. The **lithosphere** (rocks, soils, sediments, etc.)
	3. The ***atmosphere*** (gases, airborne particulates, etc.)
