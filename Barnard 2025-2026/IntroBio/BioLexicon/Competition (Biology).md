From [[Chapter 53 - Species Interactions]]

*Interspecific* competition (across separate species)
	When two separate populations have to use the same, limited resource
	Two main types:
		*Interference* competition - harm other species directly (chemical warfare, territoriality)
		*Exploitative* competition - harm from using the same resource (space, seeds. etc.)
As a result, **resource partitioning** (using different resources in different areas relative to another exploitative population; *behavioral changes*) and **character displacement** (morphologically different species that use different resources emerge from an initial spies e.g. *galapagos finches*) have developed amongst organisms in a population

[[Competitive Exclusion Principle]]

Usually present over nonrenewable resources... (space)
Renewable resources = water, sunlight, seeds
