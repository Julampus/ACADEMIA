From [[Chapter 53 - Species Interactions]]

*Ecological succession* - (dynamic) 
	Bare rock -> grasses -> perennials -> forests -> etc.
**Primary** *succession* occurs in barren habitats (if they once had organisms, it is **secondary**)
Successional stages have diversity, composition, and richness in flux -> until a **climax community** is reached
	Climax species usually larger, shade tolerant
**Aquatic succession** can dry out ponds from plant transpiration over time...

A *dis***climax** community happens when an environment isn't able to succeed (i.e. grasslands stay grassy and don't become a forest)

It's tradeoffs all the way down - r selected species

*Hypotheses for Succession*
	Facilitation hypothesis - species make the environment less livable for them but more livable for other organisms
	Inhibition hypothesis - simply whichever species has dominance over the area first
	Tolerance hypothesis - in a constant state of renewal as superior species replace inferior ones
