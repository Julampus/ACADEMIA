From [[Chapter 52 - Population Ecology]] and a subsect of [[Population Growth]]

Sidestep **[[Density-Dependent Factors]]** regulation by:
	Expanding into most terrestrial [[Habitat]]s (or [[Biome]]s)
	Increasing carrying capacity "K" (see [[Population Growth]] for equation)
	Reducing death rates (can be analyzed with Life Tables studied in [[Demography]])
	Improved medical are and sanitation
Age structure, a [[Population Characteristic]]
	More young people = more growth
		Population control
	More old people/uniform age structure = less growth
		An issue with dwindling population

**Demographic transition model** demonstrates demographic changes (and a swap in) in birth and death rates
	Divided into preindustrial, transitional, industrial, and postindustrial phases (in which growth rate and population size fall - must account for our **ecological footprint**)
