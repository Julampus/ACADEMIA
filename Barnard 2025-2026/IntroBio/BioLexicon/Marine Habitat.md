#### Marine Environments
Generally *salinity over 3%* (3/4ths of the earths surface)
Also have *photic* and *aphotic* zones, as do freshwater environments
**Zonation:**
	*Pelagic province* - water
		***neritic zone*** - shallow water above continental shelves (within 300m of the surface)
			kelp forests, coral reefs
			part of the photic zone
		***oceanic zone*** - deep water beyond continental shelves 
			open waters, seasonal photosynthesis due to upper level's filtering of sunlight
			organisms that go against currents called **nekton** (which eat plankton)
			within 50 m is the photic zone
			no sunlight below 600 m
	*Benthic province* - bottom sediments
		***intertidal zone*** - shoreline that changes with tides (divided into upper, middle, and lower (highest biodiversity in lower))
			species living on bottom are called **benthos**
			hydrothermal vents (**chemosynthetic bacteria** convert heat to energy), sediment and detritivores
		***abyssal zone*** - permanently below deeper water
			detritivores (aka. marine snow, aphotic)
*Estuaries* = river + sea (often bays/fjords...)
	bordered by *salt marshes*
	mangroves
	removal of waste, influx of nutrients = high ecological potential dubbed "productivity"

*Plankton* - aquatic organisms that don't go against the current
