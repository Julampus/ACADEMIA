**Keyword "String" is Made Up**
	Not an actual data-type in C
	A "strings" address is just one [[Hexadecimal]] number
	String "s" only shows *p* of first value and ***continues until reaching null value***

*Strings are called <u> "char *s"</u>* (example of [[Pointers]])

**To define a string:**
	typedef char \* string;

**File Pointers** - *FILE\*
- For storing *info* after a program is run
- Can be used as arguments for *fclose* or *fgetc*
- See [[File Input-Output]] fore *FILE* type and configuration
