## Introduction
Better understanding parasitism, symbiosis, and other ecological interactions in species help us better understand how to conserve populations or deal with invasive species that disrupt environments
## Key Concepts
### 53.1 - Population Interactions
Includes discussions of:
[[Coevolution]]
[[Competition (Biology)]]

[[Symbiosis]], [[Parasitism]], herbivorism, [[Commensalism]], defense, *mimicry*, **aposematic coloration** (being colored weirdly and as opposed to **cryptic coloration** for camouflage) [[Mutualism]]...
**Batesian** vs **Mullerian** mimicry
	The former is for disguising oneself as a poisonous organism, while the latter is for disguising and resembling an unpalatable species, while it itself is unpalatable (an example of [[Mutualism]])
Types of niches:
	**Fundamental niche** - what a population needs in terms of conditions and resources that it could possibly use
	**Realized niche** - what a population uses in reality

[[Global Warming]] can effect these interactions by expanding geographical range, adding organisms to communities, and changing breeding times
### 53.2 - The Nature of Ecological Communities
An *interactive* view of ecological communities suggest that species are in constant relation to one another, while *individualistic* views only see the individual organisms for what they are (*interactive* likely more accurate)

**Ecotones** result on the border between two communities, forming a gradient
**Sharp boundaries** occur because of abiotic factors (i.e. cliff, water mass, etc.) or necessary resource

**Species/Community composition** - describes the species within a community/[[Habitat]]


**Competitive exclusion principle** - experiment with *paramecium* sepcies, in which both were in exploitative [[Competition (Biology)]] for the same resource, and where one species completely dominated the other
	The principle states that two organisms cannot both exist in exploitative [[Competition (Biology)]] indefinetely (unless some third party alters the relationship)
### 53.3 - Community Characteristics
Vegetation height and complexity determined by (and is proportional to) moisture and warmth
**Foundation species** moderate the environment within communities (often necessary parts of a species, i.e. trees which shape the environment and [[Habitat]])
Communities can have varying *species richness* (# of species within a community) and *relative abundance* (# of individuals within a population) (tend to exist **dominant species**) => **community diversity**
+
[[Trophic Levels]]
### 53.4 - Effects of Population Interactions on Community Characteristics
Interspecific [[Competition (Biology)]] - affects **species composition** and structure
Predators (e.g. ***[[Keystone Species]]***/Herbivores increase *richness* by removing most competitive prey (can decrease richness too) -> if you remove it, everything is impacted
### 53.5 - Effects of Disturbance on Community Characteristics
*Disturbances* eliminate populations from communities -> some environments never at equilibrium (often human caused) - function similarly to [[Density-Dependent Factors]]
	Medium-sized disturbances let in r and k selected species, increasing richness
### 53.6 - Ecological Succession: Responses to Disturbance
See link: [[Succession]]
### 53.7 - Variations in Species Richness among Communities
Equatorial species have higher *richness* than those at the poles -> maintenance is easier due to higher free energy

**Equilibrium theory of island biogeography:**
The # of species is at balance between immigration of new species and extinction of preexisting species
Islands farther away and smaller have less diversity (the biggest islands i.e. continents have the most diversity)

[[Biodiversity]] tells you about the relationships between organisms and between their environments

Can be measured through the Shannon-Wiener's Diversity Index

## Thought Cabinet
The difference between terrestrial biomes vs. how we define aquatic biomes
	The former is defined mostly by precipitation, what grows there, and temperature
	Aquatic biomes are defined by their photic level and nutrients
Species interactions can *shift* over time
Predator-prey cycling -> **Lynx and hare**! 
Describe paramecium (two plankton competing) experiment
	Describe niche space (fundamental vs. realized) and give an example (hint, think roots)

Two types of observation - 
	*Direct* observation (what it sounds like)
	and **Indirect** observation (larger time scales)
		Tectonic shifts, geologic time
	Especially when looking at species [[Succession]]

Character displacement:
	==allopatric== populations are morphologically similar and use similar resources, but ==sympatric== populations are morphologically different and use different resources.
