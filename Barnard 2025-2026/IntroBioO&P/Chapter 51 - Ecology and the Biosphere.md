## Introduction
A chapter from [[Biology - The Dynamic Science.pdf]]
Wind flows from east to west over the pacific, influencing climate in South America, North America, Southeast Asia, and Australia
**El Nino** current (nutrient poor and warm) causes climate devastation due to altered weather patterns
	i.e. rainforests burning
	this is because the change in *pressure* caused by the currents redirects the rainfall
	pools of warm water collect in the pacific
	phytoplankton die
	heavy rains
	weaker equatorial winds
**La Nina** follows, making the winter months more humid and colder
Discusses how the [[Biosphere]], a vital component studied in [[Ecology]], relates to organismal function

## 51.2 - Environmental Diversity of the [[Biosphere]]

## 51.3 - Organismal Responses to Environmental Variation and Climate Change
**[[Climate change]]** and [[Global Warming]], more specifically, cause changes in organismal behavior, physiological properties, and the environment - see links
*facultative* responses - behavioral or physiological responses that may or may not be used by the organism 
	e.g. A case study featuring *Anolis* lizard relatives located at varying elevations (both high up on mountains and lower at the base) was conducted, showing that the species located at a higher elevation basked more frequently to make up for the cooler temperatures, while the lizards at lower elevations showed the opposite (basking less frequently...)
*torpor* - a sluggish state caused by depletion of metabolic resources (common in endotherms which require such resources for regulating heat)
## 51.4 - Terrestrial Biomes
A **[[Biome]]** makes up and determines a lot about how organisms function - see types in link
