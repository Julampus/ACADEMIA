*Evolutionary divergence* would explain how some populations were naturally selected to reproduce more offspring depending on their environments

Occurs from:
	Genetic Drift
	Gene flow
	Random Mutation
	[[Natural Selection]]
	Sexual selection - leads to sexual dimorphism
See [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]] for Null model of evolution

*Darwin's Theory*
1. **Common Ancestry** Darwin provided purely physical, rather than spiritual, explanations for the origins of biological diversity. 
2. **Struggle for Existence** Darwin recognized that evolutionary change occurs in groups of organisms, rather than in individuals: some members of a group survive and reproduce more successfully than others. 
3. **Favorability of Traits - [[Natural Selection]]** Darwin described evolution as a multistage process: variations arise within groups, natural selection eliminates
4. **Descent with Modification** Like Lamarck, Darwin understood that evolution occurs because some organisms function better than others in a particular environment

Combined with [[Mendel]]'s ideas to form *population genetics* (the importance of genetic variation as the raw material of evolution - [[Chapter 20 - Development of Evolutionary Thinking]]) 
Later, the *modern synthesis*, a combination of morphology, embryology, paleontology, and taxonomy to build an evolutionary foundation
	Outlined **micro** vs **macro** evolution

Proven by fossil evidence, ABR, comparative morphology (analyzing homologous traits), historical biogeography (especially with neighboring islands, though also with pangea)

orthogenesis - evolution produces organisms with the goal of improvement (wrong because there is no fixed goal)
