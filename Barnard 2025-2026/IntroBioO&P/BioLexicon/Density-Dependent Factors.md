As seen in [[Population Dynamics]] and as opposed to [[Density-Independent Factors]]
	Density-dependent factors reduce:
		Growth rates
		Adult size
		Survivorship
		Fecundity
	And thus regulate *population size*
	Examples of these factors include:
		Parasites, predation, competition, etc.
		Space
		Climate - in terms of human caused climate change (if viewed as natural)
		Resources
		Compassion/Sharing
		Human Intervention
		Disease
