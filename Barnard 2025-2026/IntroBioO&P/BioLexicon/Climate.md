from [[Chapter 51 - Ecology and the Biosphere]]
*changes based off of precipitation, Earth's tilt (23.5 deg), latitude (and amount of atmosphere crossed by light), and temperature*
**Climate** - "the weather conditions prevailing over an extended period of time" (1154)
**Solar Radiation** - varies around the globe due to the varying angles light hits the earth (due to being a sphere; at an oblique angle, the light takes longer to travel through the atmosphere)
	changes in radiation = changes in temperature
**Seasonality** - earth titled at *23.5 deg*, sunlight only hits directly between the tropics overhead
	during different positions in earth's orbit around the sun, either the equator, Tropic of Capricorn, or Tropic of Cancer will be directly illuminated by the sun
**Air Circulation** - varies based on the air temperature (see seasonality (line 17))
	cold air at low altitudes warms up, rises to high altitudes, cools down, and flows back around to lower altitudes centered around 30 deg north, 30 deg south, and the equator
	*Tradewinds* push to the equator (from the east)
	*Easterlies* blow... from the east (just guess for *Westerlies* idk man...)
**Precipitation** - radiation exposure and air circulation make differences in precipitation
	warmer air = more water
	dry air descends - wet air ascends as a cloud
	see [[Adiabatic Cooling]]
**Ocean Currents** - go from warm water in the equator flowing outward into the poles, cools down, and returns to equator
	surface water dictated by air circulation, forming currents
	ocean currents change moisture conditions in maritime climates
		e.g. east coast is warmer than 10 miles in as warm water from gulf is dragged up
**Temperature** - land changes temp faster than water (takes more energy))
Locations can have *continental* or *maritime* climates (e.g. London is farther north than Minneapolis, but Minneapolis weather still sucks more (is more extreme)!)
In Maritime climate seasons:
	Summer land is hotter than the water
	Winter land is colder than the water
		Heat rises and creates low pressure, causing wind to flow where the heat is
**Monsoon cycles** - wind direction reversal by season
**Rain shadow** - caused by wind from ocean, through [[Adiabatic Cooling]], precipitation falls off on windward mountain side while dry air flows over and absorbs moisture on the leeward side
**Microclimates** - like a overturned log, cave, etc. function similarly to (and can be analyzed in a similar respect for that reason as) climates, just on a micro scale
