**Species concepts:** - ways of classifying species
	*Morphological and behavioral species concept* - useful in making broad observations, but can be difficult what is a result of phenotypic variation within a species and what is actually a distinct behavioral entity
	*Reproductive isolation species concept* - the modern conception of species is based on their ability to reproduce exclusively with members of their own species to produce viable, fit offspring
		Doesn't apply to species that reproduce asexually
		Can't be used to study organisms that are long extinct	
	*Phylogenetic species concept* - based upon both genetic and morphological similarity between organisms, though falters as there aren't detailed evolutionary histories for all organisms
	Looks at smallest "monophyletic" (sharing a common evolutionary ancestor) group of organisms that share one or more diagnosable characters

Why not just use genomics?
*18s* - highly conserved part of the genome across many species
	Resolution of difference might not be achieved due to such high conservation

The answer of which concept to use depends on what type of organism you're analyzing...

Species are often separated based off of geographic location
Sometimes, members of the same species with be geographically isolated, though still able to reproduce successfully with one another. These *subspecies*, as they're called, tend to be phenotypically distinct.
	These *subspecies* often appear in ringed formation, typically when surrounding uninhabitable terrain. Referred to as border or ring species
