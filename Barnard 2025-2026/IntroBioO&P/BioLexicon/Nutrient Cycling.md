From [[Chapter 54 - Ecosystems and Global Change]]
Earth is a closed system
Biogeochemical cycling means...

*Hydrologic Cycle* - cycling of water
	Water moving through land, rivers, oceans, and air
	Heated by solar energy and evaporates into the air, cools and falls as droplets, falls into the land and flows to rivers

***Global Carbon Cycle*** - cycling of carbon
	Carbon from sedimentary rock is mostly unavailable and traded very slowly, though *available* carbon is present in bicarbonate in the ocean (baking soda)... and gaseous carbon dioxide
	Carbon fixation allows for available carbon to be incorporated organically
	Organisms then die and become incorporated into rock sediments, potentially being converted to gas, petroleum, and coal

**Nitrogen Cycle** - cycling of nitrogen
	Abundant in the atmosphere but unavailable to most organisms
	Except for in the cases of 
		Nitrogen Fixation - Nitrogen -> ammonia (mostly performed by bacteria) from the air
		Ammonification -> converts nitrogen from detritus to ammonia and ammonium
		Nitrification -> detritivores producing nitrites and and nitrates from ammonia and ammonium, which can then be incorporated into plant root systems

==Phosphorus cycle== - cycling of phosphorous and phosphates (PO4)
	mostly present in the sediment
	Erosion puts phosphates into water and ocean, where it enters marine food webs or precipitates into salt deposits
	Plants absorb the dissolved phosphates coming from these deposits, trading between animal detritus and plants
