From [[Chapter 54 - Ecosystems and Global Change]]
The ratio between the net productivity of an upper and lower trophic level (usually ***10%***, so *90%* is ==lost==)

*Harvesting efficiency* - energy from food absorbed over food available 
	i.e. how much crop is available
*Assimilation efficiency* - energy from food absorbed to food's total energy content
	Food bioavailability
*Production efficiency* - new tissue produced to energy assimilated from food
	Making new tissue from energy
