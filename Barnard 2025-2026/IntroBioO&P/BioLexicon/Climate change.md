##### Effects of large-scale Climate-Change
Polar species will constrict around the poles of the earth
Tropical and temperate species will expand towards the poles
Animals at lower elevations will move higher (to escape the heat)
See [[Chapter 54 - Ecosystems and Global Change]] for effects from nitrogen and phosphorous
