**Definition**: "a measurable increase in temperature at the Earth's surface, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere" (1159-1160, [[Chapter 51 - Ecology and the Biosphere]])
An example of [[Climate change]]
The earth has increased by about 1 degC by human causes

**Effects** of global warming include:
	Changes in flowering times of plants that function off of temperature (as seasons shift in temperature)
	Changes in migratory patterns, reproducing earlier in the year
	Changes in species habituation
	Herbivorous species of insects can now live at higher altitudes, affecting already sparse plant populations
	Cold-adapted marine life on the California coast have decreased in numbers, while warm-adapted species have increased in population
