## Main Text
*Microevolution* - a single heritable change that occurs within a population (often within the span of a single population lifetime)
	Or more simply, [[Evolution]] on the micro scale
#### 21.1 - Variation in Natural Populations
**Phenotypic variation** - variations of size, growth, colour, etc. - can be quantized with a mean often able to be found (unless expression is completely random, though it still is restricted by a range of expression)
	Can be seen across species within a population
	Can see the change in genotype expression over time through *artificial selection*

Though ***quantitative*** (discrete) variations usually occur due to varying expressions of a single gene, ***qualitative*** variations usually toggle between two or more distinct states (e.g. Two distinct colors of snow goose (white and blue))
	Understood through *polymorphisms* -> calculated by frequency of each trait (aka hair colour, eye colour, etc.)
Influenced by both *genetic* and *environmental* factors
	E.g. height, weight, hair health, predisposition to illnesses (both physical and mental)

*Genetic variation* can occur through several processes

Examples of mutations in *homo sapiens*
	Polydactyly, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, down syndrome
#### 21.2 - Population Genetics
*Gene Pool* - found by calculating genotype frequencies (frequency of trait a, trait b... trait n) and allele frequencies (relative abundance of an allele (even in heterozygous situations e.g. p and q))

[[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]
#### 21.3 - The Agents of Microevolution
See the [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]

Modes of [[Natural Selection]]
Selection can occur in the form of:
	Directional selection - shifts mean phenotype towards one end of distribution of genetic variance
		When one extreme of a trait's phenotype is preferred
		I ---> o
		E.g. shorter vs. longer neck giraffes in the presence of tall flora; tall necks are selected
	Stabilizing selection - favors the mean, variability decreases
		The intermediate phenotype is favored while extremes are favored against
		I ---> o <--- I
	Disruptive selection - the mean is heavily unfavored, what is left and right of the mean are increased drastically
		The mean is favored against
		Become more specialized over time...
		o <--- I ---> o
#### 21.4 - Maintaining Genetic and Phenotypic Variation
*Balanced Polymorphisms* - stability between two states of allele expression
	Heterozygote advantage - when heteros have higher advantage than homos
	Varying environments - e.g. rock mice for volcanic rock vs. desert sandy rock
	Frequency-dependent selection - rarer phenotypes can have higher fitness (e.g. with non-pollen-carrying orchids of varying colors influencing bee behavior)
		If heterozygotes have higher fitness, then preserves polymorphisms
		Also when different alleles are favored in different environments
		Or when rarity of a phenotype provides an advantage
		E.g. Malaria

Some variations are neutral, according to the *neutral variation hypothesis*
	Can switch to being harmful or beneficial with growth and species proliferation
#### 21.5 - Adaptation and Evolutionary Constraints
Adaptive traits can be compared in similar species without the traits, or with species in different environments - can compare [[Chaetodipus]] mice, for instance
## Thought Cabinet
Environmental influences of how the environment is shaping fitness:
	Air quality
	Nutrition
	Exercise/Activity
	Exposure to disease
	Availability of Green Space
	Access to healthcare
	Social support
	Availability of optimal sleeping conditions 
	Social media + Blue light exposure 
	==Mercury in retrograde==

Individual IQ and Air Quality has direct causal relationship (even accounting for economic and growth variances)

If there were no external selective pressures on HbA/HbS alleles for Sickle Cell anemia, then the allele for Sickle Cell will go extinct... it only remains in populations due to its relationship with malaria parasite...

Ostrich vs. Owl 
	Monocular field of view versus range of Binocular vision
	Fulfills different niches
	An example of tradeoffs in [[Natural Selection]]
Goal of the organism is to survive and reproduce -> lacks foresight beyond this
[[Coevolution]] - one species can affect the selective conditions for a second species

*Adaptions*
White fur in polar bears
Feathers in birds -> also vestigial from dinosaurs

*Vestigial Structures*
Tailbone in humans 
Pelvic bones in whales

*By-products*
Color of your tongue
Panda's thumb?
Blind spot in human eyes
