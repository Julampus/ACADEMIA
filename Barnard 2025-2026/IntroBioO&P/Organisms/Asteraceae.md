aka. the sunflower
See [[O&P Lab 5 - Sunflower Germination]] for a more in depth analysis and experiment of the sunflower.

Known for their **inflorescence** and their bright yellow ==ray florets==
Their *achenes*, the individual fruits at the center of the plant's head, have a complex formation of growth to avoid self germination.
