Over 7,000 different species
[Photosynthetic]
*Aquatic*
Simple reproductive structures
Vary drastically in size
[Chlorophyll] primarily used for photosynthetic processes, though other pigments are used to absorb light

Type of [[Phytoplankton]]
Subject to "***Algae Blooms***" if there is an uptick in phosphorous from fertilizer pollution - an example of eutrophication in [[Freshwater Habitat]]
	Can kill surrounding wildlife
	Results in low levels of dissolved oxygen
		As detritivores eat dying algae in algae blooms, they use up oxygen to metabolize the nutrients 

Often nitrogen limited, as opposed to [[Cyanobacteria]] which can fix nitrogen
