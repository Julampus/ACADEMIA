The **use-value** assigned to a [[Commodity]] based on its usefulness to the consumer/user of the commodity
	It is important to note that the use-value of a [[Commodity]] is not inherent to the object itself (ask a chemist to find the [[Use-Value]] in 10 lbs of linen and he will look at you in horror and dismay)
	Rather, the utility or "usefulness" of the [[Commodity]] is socially constructed and dependent the market within which it is contextualized by (and especially by how many labour-hours have been grafted to the product)
	This concept is distinct from an object's "value," which can simply be however much we desire the object in any given position (much more determined by subjective experience)
