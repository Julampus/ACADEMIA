%% It's a book about love... %%
### Introduction
*Eros* - translates to **desire**
	can refer to  **sexual desire** a deeper, **emotional** **desire**, and an affectionate **familiar desire** (*philia*)
*Symposium* - resembles a modern private dinner party (though segregated by sex)
	Mostly reserved for aristocracy (with young men given minor roles to be inducted into the ritual)
	Lower class women and men would perform entertainment
	Concentrated, unmixed wine would be diluted with water and divvied up for each of the guests
*Erotic-Educational Relationship*
	Adult men would have a young, pubescents boy "lover" that he would receive pleasure from in return for mentorship - *Marked a clear distinction between the **lover** and the **loved***
	Aka [[Pederasty]]
#### The Search for Objective Truth:
Plato had three general Periods of Writing:
1. Early period
	- Defined by dialects and revealing more logically consistent beliefs; not so much on finding the capital "T" Truth
	- Building off of Socrates' teachings more directly
2. Middle period
	- Discussions of Plato's *forms* (a more objective truth) become more apparent 
	- Encapsulate [[Republic]] as well as *The Symposium*
3. Late period
	- Builds off with new interpretations of *forms*
In a sense, the search for truth is, in itself, *erotic*
There is truly an emphasis on the *search* - existentialists would adopt that for themselves such as in Camus' [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]

#### The First Three Speeches
*Eulogy* - speech of praise
	In *The Symposium*, the eulogy is targeted at Eros the god
	Consist of (with respect to the subject):
		1. Good qualities other than **virtues**
		2. **Virtues**
		3. Achievements
		4. Way of Life
		5. Origin
	Delivered by ==Phaedrus==
==Pausanias== reflects more-so on that male-male, *erotic-educational* relationship and the value that comes from it
	*Common love* - purely superficial, physical
		Discouraged
	*Heavenly love* - one in which virtue arises (a. la in *erotic-educational* relationships)
		Encouraged (assuming you remove the physical sexual desire)
==Eryximachus== distinguishes between **Human** and **Natural** processes
	*Well ordered*, contrasting desires should work in harmony
	***Plato*** argues that Eryximachus limits himself too much to the pretentions of the physical
%% Socrates would disagree, instead arguing that individuals seek self-immortalization through pro-creation %%
#### The Speeches of Aristophanes and Agathon
*Comic* & *Tragic*
==Aristophanes==' *Myth of the Two People*
	People were once conjoined in two. A long time ago, everyone was split. Depending on how you were split changes your desires. 
	All about finding your **other half**
	Love is directed at *Individuals*
	Perhaps about expressing such *individuality*, or maybe just the goal to live a *shared life*
	Cute!
==Agathon== - The tragic showboat
	Demonstrates a bashful sort of wisdom that foils Socrates' more put together, methodical nature 
	Acts as the *loved one* rather than the *lover*

#### Socrates and Diotima
==Socrates:==
1. Breaks down Agathon's speech
2. Reports Diotima's view on Love
3. Reflects on the outstanding questions
Love always exists as a desire of a *"lack of something you need but are deficient in"*
It is about the *lover's*, not the *loved*, pursuit of happiness
Socrates is a **searcher**, not one who **knows**

==Diotima:==
1. Argues that love is neither god nor mortal, but a **spirit** in between
2. Poverty and Resource created Love, a combination of the two
	- Love is always in poverty (desire deficit), but finds resourceful ways to satisfy desires
3. Love is not directed at gaining "ones own," but acquiring a general good
4. The goal of love is to achieve some greatest form of good in *immortality* (potentially through the physical procreation or mental proliferation of art
5. These desires manifest themselves not only in the sexual, but in every pursuit of happiness
#### Aclibiades
==Aclibiades==:
Storms in drunk and offers a *eulogy* to Socrates
A young politician and seeming boyfriend of Socrates (in a homo-erotic educational relationship)
Socrates declines Alcibiades' sexual advances, placing emphasis on the <u>pursuit of the mental and truthful over the physical</u>
	Can be interpreted as either saying the best relationship is one that lacks that superficiality, or in fact that the pursuit of education and truth (the "ascent of knowledge) in your partner *enhances* your physical relationship
Socrates baffles Aclibiades, an example of the **confusion** he utilizes in his *cross-dialectical* technique of rhetoric that aims to have people question their own beliefs about what is true
### The Symposium (Main Text)
**Appolodorus** (the main narrator) offers a report given to him from **Aristodemus** (invited to *The Symposium* by Socrates)
Male love is often preferred and categorized as more "Heavenly" by **Pausanias** (for its respect to intelligence and self-betterment)
While **Phaedrus**' speech acts more like an introduction to Love, **Pausanias** provides a framework in which to classify love.
**Eryximachus** discusses the orderliness of love.
	Proposes love to be a happy, well-ordered medium between two contrasting extremes
- The three speeches all discuss love through the framework of the homo-erotic relationship, providing guidelines to maximize the benefit and utility of such a relationship while acknowledging the power dynamics at play
	- For instance, the *loved* boyfriend shouldn't accept common love from a *lover* who is only interested in the physical and ephemeral
	- The *lover* should approach a relationship in terms of making sure he, in a way, completely serves the boyfriend (especially in terms of education)
**Aristophanes**' myth is awesome I love it so much
**Agathon** (most eulogy-like speech IMHO) says:
	Love is not the one of the oldest of the gods (as proposed by Phaedrus), but one of the youngest
	Love as beauty (basically glazing love)
**Socrates** introduces his dialectical cross-referencing, starting simple by asking about the nature which Love originates or belongs to a certain subject (as a brother is a brother *of* a sibling or a child is a child *of* a parent)
Loves origins are in a deficit of something
Socrates's former conversation with Diotima establishes spirits (of which love is one of them) as messengers or intermediaries between gods and mortals
	The lives of spirits are neither mortal nor immortal, instead acting as emergent properties. 
		Thinking of love as **emergent** can help establish it not only as an emotion or desire, but as a socially constructed property
	Think about the *Delphic Golden Mean* between poverty and resource
	Love is the desire to fill the deficit of the ephemeral
We tend to think of love as only between individuals, but it can also appear between things. It is simply that desire. And so, naturally, it can appear not only in creation via. the sexual but creation via. the mental.
	Everyone yearns to birth the beautiful. That is, to become immortal.
**Aclibiades** is literally rivals to lovers yaoi
	It's not like i like you or anything -- baka!
	A *eulogy* to Socrates

### Closing Remarks
This text was really a treat to read. Out of Plato's works, I have a strong feeling that this one neither overstays its welcome nor underdelivers in both the complexity of its ideas and style by which it explores them. Plato's exploration of Love was incredibly refreshing, and the diverse perspectives offered by the guests of the Symposium highlighted the exciting parts of the [[Republic]]'s dialectics (namely the exchanges with Glaucon and Thrasymachus).
It is really beautiful too see such creativity and complex thought from two and a half millennia ago. The cultural references, though a bit more formal than what I'm used to, feel like a modern version of an internet forum or white-guy podcast. And yet, the honesty with the homo-erotic relationships is surprising, especially when contrasted with the general narrative offered by "The West" that tends to exclude this homo-eroticism. All of the characters are witty and poignant, even if some only get a few pages of dialogue. Every page feels necessary and full of content. 
The ideas presented, mostly in terms of praising, analyzing, and categorizing Love, all offer what feels like a pretty decisive take on how to interpret the subject. Although, in true Socrates fashion, no answers are given, just the methods by which such truths can be chased.
In terms of any outstanding questions, I am curious about adapting these frameworks to modern structures of erotic love (Nuclear family, t4t, polygamy, sexual commerce), as well as exploring the love present in all desires (which honestly could've been explored more by Socrates' account of Diotima's framework). 
Aristophanes' myth of the lovers has to be, by far, one of my favorite myths, even if it fails to address certain biological and social questions about love (pitfalls inherent to any sort of "soul-mate" narrative.
A truly remarkable text.
