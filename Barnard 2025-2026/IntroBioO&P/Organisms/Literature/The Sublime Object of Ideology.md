##### Preface: *The Idea's Constipation?*
%% A response to critics of Hegelian analysis %%

**Ptolemization:** the process by which an intellectual revolution, defined by adding complications within the terms of a given framework, occurs.
	Used in the context of "shaking things up," as the philosophical discipline was in crisis in the early 2000's
**Copernication:** the process by which a type of revolution that switches up the framework itself occurs
	Can be seen as the inverse of Ptolemization
		Some say Freud introduced a copernician revolution to Psychoanalysis, though perhaps he just worked within the framework of classical psychology, a ptolemaic relation
- Though alone they may be ptolemic, when synthesized they can gain new weight
- Zizek offers that, as a child goes from a sporadic and expressionistic, colorful artist to a rigid and grey one, it is not a loss of creativity but a gain in emotional and spiritual determination, a Hegelian/Lacanian idea.
*Aufhebung:* The "*sublation*" (removal) of all immediate reality 
	An idea in reductionism
*Befreien:* "To liberate,"
*Ablegen:* "To discard"
*Abrogation:* "Sublation of Sublation" (xiv)
	Occurs in spurious moments of absolute knowledge
Another Hegelian idea: ***substance and subject*** are in *constipation*, meaning the former contains within it, and is thus inextricably tied to, the latter
	It's giving **Devouring Mother**
The move from substance to subject is called *contraction*
	Zizek colorfully refers to shitting, here 
%% Perhaps what the critics of Hegel need, then, is a large dose of an effective laxative %%
##### Introduction:
Zizek seeks to analyze the hesitancy to discuss solely Lacanian psychoanalysis (as in a case with author and philosopher Habermas, Lacan is only discussed through the lens of Althusser)
Althusserian psychoanalysis has to do with the *alienation of self*, (perhaps in the existentialist sense) while Lacan deals more with *separation*
- If we completely remove the barrier between the real and its "symbolization," we lose access to our own **desires** (which are born in that divide)
While **Marxism** centers mostly around the concepts of global revolution to dissolve class divides (which are theorized to be the birth place of all other divisions [sex, race, etc.]), **Post-Marxism** (naturally) breaks away from this revolutionary notion
Zizek argues that these fundamentalist movements (fundamental feminism, ecologism, psychoanalysis-ism, etc.) all ignore the natural divides within people
	Perhaps because the structures they seek to become **fundamentalists** in are themselves based in antagonism
	This fundamentalism, ironically, calls for the abolition of their own structures
		A movement that requires the destruction of the movement
	On "*the acknowledgement of a fundamental antagonism*"

Outlines 3 main goals:
1. Discuss and introduce Lacanian psychoanalysis, taking into account its "Copernician" break from structuralism (**Post-Structuralism**)
2. Discuss Hegelian dialectics through a modern lens and with modern applications
3. Synthesize the two theories to contribute to the theory of ideology (and combat the notion that we are "post-ideology" [or even post truth])
%% Zizek is definitely more socially right-leaning than me, though we both share similar frustrations with economics and the state of disillusionment stemming from post-modernism...lets see how it all goes down %%

##### Chapter I: The Symptom
###### How Did Marx Invent the System?
Zizek argues that Marx and Freud are connection in their understandings of commodity and dreams, respectively
