## Essay by Zora Neale Hurston
#essay #barnard 
Zora outlines her path to becoming *Racialized* or being assigned to her a race in Eatonville, Florida "exclusively a colored town"
	A space between more important spaces
	
Hurston watched (notably, northern and white) tourists from the porch
	The show // The actors, distance between worlds
		Reminiscent of Ta Nehisi Coates [[Between the World and Me]]
	While the passersby gave her change and she would welcome them (and dances and speeches), the town did not (though saw her truly as Zora)

"White people rode through town but never lived there"
After moving to Jacksonville, Zora was quickly judged merely as a racial category, something not outwardly present in Orange county
Hurston is adamant that she does not submit herself to nature and concede that she simply received the short hand of the stick for being racialized, but rather she's "too busy sharpening my oyster knife"

"Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and the price is not paid with me"
"The game of keeping what one has is never as exciting as the game of getting"
In these quotes above, Zora acknowledges how being assigned a racial category forces her to interact with life differently

Frequent imagery of contrast, of **dichotomy**
"dark rock against a white background" (e.g. *Barnard*)
References a flowing river (naturalistic imagery, despite disavowing it viewing race as such before) as Barnard

"The Jungle Way" -> Listening to jazz, a "primitive" urge takes over, impassioned
Hurston and her date have different experiences in the *proximity* and **closeness** to the subject matter, separated "dimly across the *ocean* [more naturalistic imagery] and the continent that had fallen between us"

The "cosmic Zora" (untethered/abolished from race, sex, economic status, etc.)

Different bags as different races
	Zora is proclaiming we ought to jumble its contents
