##### Book VII - Rulers, Philosophy, and Education
- 261. For the <u>philosopher rulers</u> of the republic, their education is of utmost importance. They must learn of arithmetic and geometry (to study the make-up of things), motion and physics (to know how their world moves), and the heavenly bodies of astronomy and music (to know their place within the universe [both spiritual and physical, what can be seen and can't])
	- This revelation of what before could not be seen with plain eyes (and thus must be "seen" through reason) is reflected by Plato's Cave.
- 264. Dialectic will be mastered to iterate upon knowledge until truth is achieved.
- 265. The goal is to parse through the ***beliefs***, based in **conjecture**, that can blind us and get to **truth**, a form of knowing that involves ***intelligence***. The goal of this **truth** is to identify what real "==good==" is.
- 270. Socrates tells to Glaucon to imagine a child, swapped at birth, who grows up in an affluent family. *Before* learning of this switch, Socrates proposes that the child acts with more respect towards authority. *After* such a revelation (that being a theme which Socrates consistently plays with in the second half of the text), the child begins to question authority more, as the world sold to him before appears to be a lie. The respect instead goes to the child's "flatterers," which can be viewed as either yes-men or simply those who follow his command
	- Interestingly, the child becomes a new authority
	- Socrates offers that philosophers must both analyze what is *good*,  ***just***, and **beautiful** in order to come to that truth, ==without== losing respect towards their forms
		- The goal is to *abide* the law, in his mind, *not to mistrust* it
	- Dialectic is the passage to truth
##### Book VIII - The Types of Philosophical Cities
- 274. A point that Socrates consistently advocates for is the equality in access between men and women, their roles not relying on their sexes, but rather, their **natures**.
- 275. Another point discussed prior is this form of *Platonic Utopia*, in which:
	- Property appears to be abolished, people share goods as well as each other
	- Everyone is committed to a cause greater than themselves
	- Everyone takes pride in their nature and the work they are fit for
- 276. The Four Regimes:
	1. Timocracy/Timarchy (Referred to as Cretan/Spartan)
		- On rules of honor, fighting, and glory
		- Resembles common notions of Trumpian authoritarianism, fascism, or even sharia
		- Spawned, as Socrates puts it, from a *masculine desire for revenge* and overcoming (described in a near Oedipean sense)
		- In the Nietzschean sense, this regimes currency, rather than gold, is the ***[[Will to Power]]***
			-  To me, its the pleasure that's mirrored in athletes. Its the "love of the game" more than anything else. The contracts come later. 
	2. Oligarchy
		- Stemming from a desire for riches and money-making after the collapse of The City, or even a Timocracy, so says Socrates
		- Allows for poverty, as **money-making breeds disparity**, as well as depraved crime
		- The regime comes first, then the oligarchic man
	3. Democracy
		- The poverty and crime spawned from the Oligarchy will arm the impoverished, brandishing their weapons. "Let them eat cake," the Oligarchs cry! Revolution breeds Democracy
			- This framework of a *political system birthed from revolution* is a parallel to Marx's Communism, as proposed in the revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoise ([[Communist Manifesto]]))
		- Because of the freedom that a Democracy offers, Socrates argues that pure natures with great potential can be trampled more easily by a lack of beauty in one's upbringing. (True that, brother)
			- Inversely, it allows those with poor natures to run for office. Glaucon proclaims this acceptance as noble. It doesn't matter what you did in your past. You can move forward. You can change. You are still here, still alive. This is all you have.
		- The Democrat chases the *unnecessary pleasures* that spend and don't give much in return (needless sex, needless eating, needless sloth) while the thrifty Oligarch spends only insofar as it returns on his investment
			- In a way, the suppression of these *pleasures* by the Oligarchs is what eventually prompts class resentment in the soon-to-be democrat
		- Socrates/Plato certainly has a disdain (though he calls them beautiful pg298) for the democrats, painting them out to be pleasure-seeking idealogues, ignoring the truth of reason
	4. Tyranny
		- Comes from the destruction of democracy, the pursuit of their believed good (for Timocrats, power; for Oligarchs, money; for Democrats, freedom)
			- In an excess of freedom, crime, anarchy, and unrest take hold, unrest that seeks to be resolved with strong order - slavery and tyranny
		- The Tyrant is the "*people's champion*"
		- Yet to Tyranny, Socrates is the most critical, illustrating the abuse of power that can come from such a regime, eventually culminating in either the people driving the tyrant out, or the tyrant dominating the people
	- The goal for Glaucon and Socrates is to paint the most unjust ruler in each type of rulership in order to craft the most just in each, synthesizing into a fifth, **just** type
- 279. The city will come to an end, like everything, Socrates states. His *temporary utopia,* ending with human error, is similar to the existentialist notion of the **crystal palace**, expressed in Fyodor Dostoevsky's [[Notes from Underground]]
	- As gradual as falling sand in an hourglass

%% I urge myself to look further into the "Metal Myth" and its relation to the concept of eugenics. Though Socrates isn't inherently advocating for the removal of any neurodivergent or physically disabled people, his society isn't made for them. Is it utopia, then, if it only is for a select few. If the answer is yes, then perhaps we live in a utopia right now, just only for Musk, Bezos, and the like. %%

##### Book IX - The Unjust City
- This book's main goal is to identify the city and, by extension, the individual that is the most unjust in order to construct justice in its truest of rulers
- Socrates adds the kingdom to the list of cities, treating it as more just than tyranny
- Defines the 3 types of desires (310):
	- 1. Savage Desire:
		- Hunger, thirst, instinct, all revealed to us when logic is asleep: in our dreams.
		- The drunkenness, lust, and madness is that fit for a tyrant
- Socrates reminds Glaucon of the 3 parts of the soul (ranked in order of prefference):
	- 1. ==The philosophical, rational part== 
		- Those who follow this part are the knowledge-lovers
		- The part which Socrates favors most of all for its true happiness and justice
	- 2. The spirited, irrational part
		- Those who follow this part are the honor-lovers
	- 3. The "appetitive," desireful part 
		- Those who follow this part are the money-lovers
- Tyranny, itself, is the *least just* and *least happy* the spectrum of kingship to tyranny, this absolute-ruler scale
- Not just any tyrant is the most unhappy individual, but the tyrant who once lived a moral, disciplined life (322)
- Socrates assumes, with Glaucon, that the city reflects the individual; what is true for one is true for the other, formally.
- There is a discussion about the **satiation** of the different aspects of the soul and of people, and where goodness arises from appetitive and emotive satiation
	- Those that chase money-making and honor-earning can only become fully
	- satiation and in a state of goodness with the aid of **wisdom**
	- Those that are hungry, emotively dry, or otherwise empty are less complete and less good (at least in a formal sense) to the full and complete
		- Interesting when considering entropy...
- Socrates invents another *myth*, in which man is molded with three beasts (representing the three desires). The just, admirable man keeps the tempers in check, not letting the beast within take hold as the unjust man would. (336)

##### Book X - Poetics and Good in the City
- Especially when considered under a formal lens, the poets and other artistic imitators that are not reality but merely reflect it, as a mirror, have no place in Socrates' city 
- The tragedians and imitators (poets) do not distinguish between the good and the bad, only imitating and never putting their ***wisdom*** into practice
- There exists expertise in *making*, **using,** and ***imitating*** objects
	- Similar to my conversation with Dr. Alan Love about causation & teleology
- The whole form of a persons soul cannot afford to be split up into differing, opposing ideologies, and so the entertaining of such is folly and overall damaging.
- If badness breaks down the soul as disease does to the body, than the ultimate form of badness is nonexistence, and the ultimate of good, **immortality**
	- Socrates urges that, formally, this decomposition of the soul is only mediated by a bad soul. A formally good soul would be impervious, even to external badness
- Justice, then, aided by the immortal pursuit of knowledge, is nourishment to a healthy, happy soul
- Socrates closes with a beautiful depiction of the afterlife, courtesy of Er:
	- The warrior Er dies in battle, and twelve days after his death, his body still not decomposed, he sees himself venturing to the afterlife. The just and unjust are judged accordingly, with the former receiving gifts and praise while the latter is punished. In the end, the immortal souls are offered to drink from the river of forgetfulness and remove their past life from their souls. Via. lottery, the souls begin to start a life anew.
