## Why It Matters
## Main Text
The algae blooms from (phosphorus) agricultural runoff in *Lake Erie* has permanently disrupted the lake body's ecosystem
	Native edible fish have gone extinct, bottom dwellers are in higher populations
	An example of ecosystem [[Ecology]]
#### 54.1 - Modeling Ecosystem Processes
Ecosystem = A biological community + the abiotic factors that interact with each other
**Food webs** show how energy and nutrients are connected and transfer across organisms
	Must be able to draw from memory (Trophic pyramid)
	Must be able to interpret bottom-up influence vs top-down predation
	Can dissect stomachs to see diets of organisms
		99% of light from  the sun is reflected or not absorbed by plants
		6CO2 + 6H20 -> C6H126 + 6O2
*Compartment models* show energy flow and nutrient cycle
	**General Compartment model** - divides nutrient cycles into available/unavailable and organic/inorganic
***Simulation Models*** are mathematical equations that represent relationships between populations and their physical environments (i.e. Ecosystems) => Makes predictions in structure and function

**Biogeochemical cycles** - how all nutrients on earth are constantly recycled (as opposed to sunlight which is absorbed and constantly renewable

*Simulation models* - mathematical equations that make predictions on the interactions of organisms
	Need to identify species, energy flow, etc.
#### 54.2 - Energy Flow and Ecosystem Energetics
**Gross** **primary** [[Productivity (Biology)]] - the rate at which primary producers convert sunlight to available chemical energy
	**GPP**
*Net primary productivity* - gross primary productivity minus the energy required for organism maintenance
	Increases with temperature and precipitation on land
	**GPP** - R (respiration) = *NPP*
The element in short supply is the *limiting nutrient* (if absent, limits [[Productivity (Biology)]])
Standing crop biomass/*standing stock biomass* - dry weight of a primary producer in a given ecosystem at a given time
*Secondary [[Productivity (Biology)]]* - amount of energy that is absorbed by a consumer of biomass (often herbivore)

**[[Ecological Efficiency]]** - see link

*Ecological pyramids* - illustrate trophic level energy availability/biomass/population count
	[[Biological Magnification]]
**Total biomass** of producers in [[Marine Habitat]]s is very high due to *high turnover rates* in phytoplankton and other primary producers

A [[Trophic cascade]] occurs when (often a predator) interaction two trophic levels up regulates organisms lower in trophic level
	e.g. grass in salt marshes allowing to grow thanks to regulation of herbivores by predators in upper [[Trophic Levels]] 
#### 54.3 - Nutrient Cycling in Ecosystems
[[Nutrient Cycling]]
#### 54.4 - Human Activities and Anthropogenic Global Change
Gases create a greenhouse effect
	i.e. CO2
	Raises average surface temperature and disrupts environments
Nitrogen fixation cycles have been disrupted from fertilizer production and other human activity
	Pollutes aquatic ecosystems (think algae blooms)
	Causes acid precipitation
	[[Climate change]] - droughts, acidification of aquatic habitats, pollution, etc.

Respiration, growth, reproduction -> how energy is allocated

**Standing stock** - energy to biomass ratio
	In terrestrial environments, energy and biomass of producers trumps other levels
	Phytoplankton produce most of the energy, but make up a small amount of the biomass (due to being eaten so fast)
	Predated on less in terrestrial areas and are a lot bigger (and have larger lifespans; the inverse for aquatic organisms)

*DDT* used as insecticide, started killing birds because of [[Biological Magnification]] 
	Rachel Carson... look into
