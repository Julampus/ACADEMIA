## Why it matters
Evolution first written about by both Darwin and Wallace, though Darwin got most of the credit. Outlined a robust theory of [[Evolution]] that we cannot think of a Biology without 
## Main Text
#### 20.1 - Recognition of Evolutionary Change
Proto-biology was called **Natural History** (a study that looked at organisms in their environments that emphasized fixed characteristics)
	Christian ideologues interpreted these fixed characteristics of organisms through the lens of **Natural theology**, using evidence of a perfect God to affirm the static-ness of species
#### 20.2 - Scientists Slowly Became Aware of Change in the Natural World
**[[Biogeography]]** - the world distribution of plants and animals

*Morphology* - comparing the anatomical structure and their respective functions in various organisms
	Vestigial structures argued to have been functional in ancestral organisms even before the theory of evolution

Fossils showed evidence of prior organisms (at the time believed to not have been discovered yet) - theory of *catastrophism* formed (of mass local extinctions wiping out ecosystems before an idea similar to ecological succession would take hold)
	**Hutton** contrasted *Cuvier's* theory with his own theory of global **gradualistic change**

**Lamarcks** theory of stretching and *biological perfecting principle*

#### 20.2 - Darwin's Journeys
"bigger beets, plumper pigs, and prize-winning pigeons"

*Evolutionary divergence* would explain how some populations were naturally selected to reproduce more offspring depending on their environments

See [[Evolution]] for Darwin's explanation

#### 20.3 - Evolutionary biology since Darwin

Evolution notably not always gradual -> *Gregor Mendel* follows with pedigree tables

## Thought Cabinet
Evolution evidence from:
1. Biogeography
2. Comparative morphology
	1. Species taxonomy (namely for specific breeding) - single celled organisms cannot be taxonomized in the same way
		Looking for 18s eukaryotic ribosomal small subunit signature
		For prokaryotes, 16s
			90% the same, same genus
			95% or higher, the same species
3. Fossil evidence

Leclert - French naturalist
	Positioned humans beneath angels, believed no inter-species relations could influence change
Linnaeus
	Founded modern taxonomy
	Kingdom phylum class order family genus species
Lamarck - French naturalist
	Principle of use and disuse, inheritance of acquired characters (giraffes stretching necks) - debunked when thinking about adaptation vs acclimation
Lyell - Principles of Geology
	Earth changes *slowly* over a long time (gradualism)
Malthus - eugenicist
	"Social Darwinism"
	Believed food was the limiting factor for humans
 
**Darwin** - The Beagle (his ship, left family at 22)
	Organism herder, picked up anything he could
	For ~5 across the world
	Artificially selecting based off of physical appearance demonstrates evolution

Wallace came up with natural selection at the same time as Darwin, though rejected sexual selection (makes sense when considering his religious background)

[[Natural Selection]] 

Religious -> Enlightenment/Atheistic ideals
