### 55.1 - The Biodiversity Crisis on Land, in the Sea, and in River Systems
Deforestation
+
Desertification (ground water receding so that less water is available)
+
Global Warming
= Positive Feedback Loop

[[Biodiversity]] - See link

Hydrologic alterations from dams and other factors change [[Marine Habitat]]s and organismal [[Life History]]

Extinction often a result from ***overexploitation***
### 55.2 - Specific Threats to biodiversity
*Habitat Fragmentation* - when habitat patches are reduced (only smaller populations can fill these niches now)
Pollution spreads via. [[Biological Magnification]]

Invasive species can cause extinction between other species through [[Parasitism]] or by carrying foreign diseases

Humans have caused the world biomass of insects to drop by **40%** since 1975
### 55.3 - Ecosystem Services That Biodiversity Provides
Diverse ecosystems provide 
	*provisioning* services (e.g. Natural Product) 
	*regulating* and *support* services (holding water and nutrients, purifying air, removing waste, pollination.)

### 55.4 - Which Species and Ecosystems Are Most Threatened by Human Activities
Several organisms are in danger of extinction - measured by the IUCN... categorizes and taxonomizes extinction
	[[Extinction]]
### 55.5 - Conservation Biology: Principles and Theory
[[Conservation Biology]]
Species-area effect: large [[habitat]] patches harbor more species than small [[habitat]] patches

Analyses of diversity = *beta-diversity*

### 55.6 - Conservation Biology: Practical Strategies and Economic Tools
[[Preservation (Biology)]]
[[Mixed-use Conservation]]
[[Restoration (Biology)]]
## Thought Cabinet
Biodiversity loss is **1000x** higher than background rate

Mass extinction = loss of 75% of species in the world

Should we commit half the earth to wildlife? 6th mass extinction?

*Targeted* and *Bycatch* - Sharks and rays are some of the most threatened ([[Extinction]]) vertebrate groups 

Targeted hunting causes genetic drift - trophy hunting, the largest animals are selected out

Cats are the most *invasive* organism in NA - example of invasive species

Spatial differentiation of diversity - habitat fragmentation
	Increases isolation
	Patch size decreases
	Number of species decreases
	Edge habitat = area around the habitat
	**Edge habitat** species increase while interior habitat species decrease.
	Supports lower population (k)

Volume vs. Surface area (surprise surprise, circle comes out on top ITS ALL CELLS)

Interdisciplinary studies help inform our research

Biodiversity hotspots targeted

Whale and bald eagle conservation in the U.S. are success stories (with an asterisk)

*Umbrella species* is a species whose conservation indirectly protects many other species... similar to [[Keystone Species]] but less **direct**
	E.g. to protect pandas, you gotta protect the environment
	Whereas with keystone species, you got to protect the species to protect the environment
