## Why It Matters
Hunting for birds of paradise ([[Paradisaea apoda]])
	Both western explorers and indigenous people on the island of New Guinea had the same classifications for all the species of birds found on the island

If species truly are an inherent, natural biological category, then understanding how species form and change over time is crucial to our understanding of how species differ from and interact with one another

See [[Species]]

**Cline** - a "smooth pattern of variation [in species] across a geographical gradient"

#### 22.4 - Genetic Mechanisms of Speciation
*Polyploidy* (extra copies of chromosomes present in genotype) common in plants:
	**allopolyploidy** -   spontaneous doubling of homologous chromosomes that don't pair due to hybrid reproduction
	**autopolyploidy** - spontaneous self-doubling of copies of chromosomes, making *unreduced gametes* (gametes with the same number of chromosomes as their somatic cells that they originated from) double in size during fertilization

Chromosomal fusions or other changes can also result in [[Speciation]]
	E.g. humans vs. chimps... ancestral chimp DNA fused at some point, resulting in a chromosomal count of 2n = 48 to 2n = 46
