## Why It Matters
Hunting for birds of paradise ([[Paradisaea apoda]])
	Both western explorers and indigenous people on the island of New Guinea had the same classifications for all the species of birds found on the island

If species truly are an inherent, natural biological category, then understanding how species form and change over time is crucial to our understanding of how species differ from and interact with one another

#### 22.1 - What is a Species?
**Species concepts:** - ways of classifying species
	*Morphological species concept* - useful in making broad observations, but can be difficult what is a result of phenotypic variation within a species and what is actually a distinct behavioral entity
	*Reproductive isolation species concept* - the modern conception of species is based on their ability to reproduce exclusively with members of their own species to produce viable, fit offspring
		Doesn't apply to species that reproduce asexually
		Can't be used to study organisms that are long extinct
	*Phylogenetic species concept* - based upon both genetic and morphological similarity between organisms, though falters as there aren't detailed evolutionary histories for all organisms

Species are often separated based off of geographic location
Sometimes, members of the same species with be geographically isolated, though still able to reproduce successfully with one another. These *subspecies*, as they're called, tend to be phenotypically distinct.
	These *subspecies* often appear in ringed formation, typically when surrounding uninhabitable terrain. Referred to as border or ring species

**Cline** - a "smooth pattern of variation [in species] across a geographical gradient" 
#### 22.2 - Maintaining Reproductive Isolation
Reproductive isolating mechanisms - genetic and physical traits that prevents the creation of *hybrid* and keeps species distinct - split into two categories
	Pre-zygotic isolation (before/during fertilization)
		ecological
		temporal
		behavioral
		mechanical 
		gametic
	Post-zygotic isolation (after fertilization)
