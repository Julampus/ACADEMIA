## Why it Matters... 
Invasive animals can disrupt populations (Rabbits in Victoria, Australia)
	The bunnies adapted to whatever technologies researchers threw their way
		Viruses, fences, predators, etc.
An example of how questions about **population dynamics** (populations changing) can help us inform decisions about the world around us
## Key Concepts
### 52.1 Population Characteristics
See [[Population Characteristic]]
### 52.2 Demography
See [[Demography]]
### 52.3 The Evolution of Life Histories
See [[Life History]]
Energy budget of an organism is dependent on maintenance, growth, and reproduction ("trade-offs")
	A trade-off e.g. = fecundity and parental care
		**Passive** vs. *Active* parental care (what was physically inherited from seed/womb that the female provides vs. what is given after birth)
	Some organisms only experience one reproductive event called a [[Semelparity]] (in contrast to an **[[Iteroparity]]**)
