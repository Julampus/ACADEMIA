## Lab Description
In this lab, we discussed the ways in which experiments are designed, the ways in which error can occur in experiments, and we conducted our own experiment on the relationship between Green Roof Height and Pollinator (Bee) Abundance. This was conducted on the second and fourth levels of Barnard College's Milstein Library. Pollinator visits were measured over three minutes of time as flowering ==sedum== plant quantities were collected. Data analysis was performed in the following lab session.
## Notes
Predictor variable and response variable:
In **Manipulative Experiment**:
Predictor variable is the **independent** variable that the researchers change, while the response variable is **dependent** 

In a *Natural Experiment*:
Predictor variable is called the *explanatory* variable, while the response variable is the *observational* variable 

Science is **Dynamic**

*Extraneous variables* are sources of experimental error that produce an unwanted or undesirable  (Associated with two types of error)
impact on the outcome of your study.
On *Error*:
**Systematic** errors come from human error and faulty tools
**Random** error mitigated by more data

Doing random sampling can reduce errors, but you benefit more from a larger sample size so do that

[[Mutualism]] can describe the relationship between bees and flowers

Looking at *Plant-pollinator* interactions

Characteristics of a flower such as its odor, shape, and color are referred
to as **pollinator syndromes**
