## Lab Description
This lab had us going to the roof of Barnard College's Diana center in order to evaluate the species richness and diversity of a plot of green roof. This was in order to understand how ecological [[Succession]] takes place. 
The Diana Center's green roof provides a good case study for answering this question, as it had ceased receiving upkeep due to supposed building safety regulations. As such, plant organisms were given ample time to sprout in the original green roof plots. We were able to observe how a plot entirely made of ==sedum== had undergone a complete change [[Biodiversity]]
We analyzed these changes using the Simpsons diversity index:
Where n is the number of organisms in a species in a given community and N is the total number of organisms in the population
## Notes
Simpsons diversity index:
$$
\sum n(n -1)) / N(N-1)
$$

The Simpsons Reciprocal Diversity Index is just the inverse of the value above. A higher number in the SRDI indicates a higher overall species diversity, whereas a lower number in the SRDI indicates a lower overall species diversity.
