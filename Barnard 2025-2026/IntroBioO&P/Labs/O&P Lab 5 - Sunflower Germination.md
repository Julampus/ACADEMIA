## Lab Description
In this lab, we planted sunflower ([[Asteraceae]]) seeds in three planters filled with different growing media: Soil, Soil & Gravel, and Soil & Woodchips. We predicted that the sunflowers would grow best in pure soil, as the general scientific consensus is that sunflowers growing in soil and woodchips slows growth rate and stunts potential growth height.
A dissection of the individual florets of the sunflower was conducted.
A collection and analysis of the data will be performed the following lab
## Notes
Two main parts of plant reproductive system:
	*Stamen* (male reproductive organ)
		Anther (pollen grain development)
		Filament (stalk of the organ)
	**Carpel** (female reproductive organ)
		Stigma (tip of the *pistil (central stem of flower)*)
		Style (stalk of the *pistil*)
		Ovary (rounded base of the *pistil*)
		Ovule (internal organ within the ovary)

***Pollination:***
Pollen grains from *stamen*'s anther -> Stigma in **carpel**

*Inflorescence*
Composed of a group of many flowers put together
	Aka composite flowers (part of the family *Compositae*)

Sunflower flower head split into:
1. Ray florets (longer, outer petals; sterile, but attract pollinators)
2. Disc florets (have stamens and pistils, singular ovary)

Three developmental stages:
	Immature disc floret (sealed structure, inner)
	Staminate disc floret (develop stamen first)
	Pistilate stage (developed pistils too)
		Reduces risk of self fertilization, as stamen develop first

Sunflower fruit - Achene
	*Pericarp* - outer protection
	*Seed* - inner product... the part you consume
			Endosperm - nutritious tissue within seed, results from fertilization by second plant sperm
			Seed embryo:
				==Cotyledons== - seed leaf (embryonic center of the seed; serves as nutritional center of plant until it can germinate)
				<u>Radicle</u> - embryonic root
				Hypocotyl - region where cotyledons attach to radicle
				[Plumule] - everything you find above the soil
				
Seed embryo consumes endosperm, enters *dormancy* and waits for optimal conditions
	Water, pH, etc.
	Grows out of pericarp during *Germination*

Angiosperms: Helianthus annuus
Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed by fruit

## Substrate Paper
Germination rate was highest in soil substrates
	More sawdust saw a decrease in germination rate
	Seedling height highest in sand substrates (with poultry manure) (with soil closely behind)

Note: all germination rates in the study were less than 80%
	 due to poor soil water content (7), seed soil contact (31), inaccurate seed placement, low and high soil temperatures (7), soil insects or soil borne disease, soil compaction or smearing (23), and surface crusting after sowing and poor quality seeds
