Predictor variable and response variable:
In *Manipulative Experiment*:
**Predictor variable** is the *independent* variable that the researchers change, while the **response variable** is *dependent* 

In a *Natural Experiment*:
**Predictor variable** is called the *explanatory* variable, while the **response variable** is the *observational* variable 

Science is **Dynamic**

*Extraneous variables* are sources of experimental error that produce an unwanted or undesirable  (Associated with two types of error)
impact on the outcome of your study.
On *Error*:
**Systematic** errors come from human error and faulty tools
**Random** error mitigated by more data

Doing random sampling can reduce errors, but you benefit more from a larger sample size so do that

[[Mutualism]] can describe the relationship between bees and flowers

Looking at *Plant-pollinator* interactions

Characteristics of a flower such as its odor, shape, and color are referred
