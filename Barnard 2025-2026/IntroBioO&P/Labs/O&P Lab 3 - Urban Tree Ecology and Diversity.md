## Lab Description
In this lab, we went out and identified five trees located on 114th street planted by the city of New York City. We conducted these identifications by analyzing the shape and structure of the tree's leaves. We also conducted an evaluation on the general health of the trees.
We also researched different organizations based in NYC that have to do with environmental advocacy.
My group looked specifically at [Forest for All](https://forestforall.nyc/), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to build and maintain a healthy urban forest for all by advocating for informed and productive environmental legislation and increase awareness on environmental advocacy.
## Notes
Urban forests (anywhere where there exists a collection of trees) provide huge benefits to cities, especially NYC
	Helps prevent NYC sewage overflow, as tree roots suck up most of the rain water that would otherwise go into sewage and storm drains
	Helps mitigate *some* of the CO2 that we emit 
	Provides shade through its canopy and cooling through transpiration, which helps a lot because the city is so hot
The trees must be counted and actively taken care of
	Used to be counted through physical census every 10 years, now we have LiDAR
*Coniferous*
	Needle-Like
	Scale-like
**Deciduous**
	Broad leaf
		Compound (multiple leaflets)
			Palmately  - centered around a point
			Pinnately - centered around an axis
		Simple (Just one leaf blade)
			Palmately  - centered around a point
			Pinnately - centered around an axis
	Also
		Alternate arrangement on branch
		Opposite arrangement on branch
Petiole (the stemmy part) and blades (the leafy part)

When looking for damage in a tree, check for
	Holes in truck
	Damaged/weak branches
	Nooks and cavities
	Fungi
	Poor pruning
	Yellow leaves

*10-20-30* **Santamour's formula** of no more than the first of the same species of tree, the second of same genus, and third of same family
