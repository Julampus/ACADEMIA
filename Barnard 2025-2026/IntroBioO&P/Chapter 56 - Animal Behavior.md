### 56.1 - Instinctive and Learned Behaviors
[[Behavior (Biology)]]
Behaviors, though having both *learned* and **instinctive** parts, often lean much greater towards one than the other
	 Development plays key role in producing certain behaviors

*Instinctive* - a behavior that is completed completely on the first time it is induced
==Fixed action patterns== - fixed actions that exhibit in response to very simple (often repeated cues)

Garter snakes have food preferences (a behavior) that is dependent on a genetic difference between the snakes...
	Indicative of behaviors and genetics as a whole

E.g. in herring gulls, the red dot on their bill cause offspring to start begging

[[Learning (Biology)]] 
### 56.2 - Neurophysiological and Endocrine Control of Behavior
**Proximate causes** Anatomy, physiology, and organismal biochemistry (e.g. Hormones) all interact with behavior
vs. *Ultimate causes* - why behaviors have adaptive value and why the genetic and physiological mechanisms subject to change
Nuclei (clusters of neurons) interact with one another to produce behavior
Hormones control behaviors change hormones... cycle of endocrine control

Brain structure determines bird call
### 56.3 - Migration and Wayfinding
Migration can occur seasonally
	*Piloting* - using familiar landmarks to guide orientation
	*Compass orientation* - use the sun, stars, light, or the magnetic field as a guide
	*Navigation* - animals use mental maps (e.g. Sea Turtles)
### 56.4 - Habitat Selection and Territoriality
**Kineses** - movement (generally towards habitat) (changes in movement demonstrate habitat formation)
*Taxes* - arrangement away from area (e.g. phototaxis, avoiding light, reacting to the environment)
Habitat selection generally genetic, though some behavioral patterns influence this too
Having territory costs
	Time
	Energy
	Risk of injury
	Exposure to predators
### 56.5 - The Evolution of Communication
**Signaler**, *Signal receiver* - communicator and communicatee
Can be:
	Visual
	Chemical
	Tactile
	Electrical (fish in [[Freshwater Habitat]] with electric organs)
	Acoustical
### 56.6 - The Evolution of Reproductive Behavior and Mating Systems
Males often compete for access to females, often attempt to inseminate many females
Females prefer males with "successful" features and thus, robust alleles
### 56.7 - The Evolution of Social Behavior
Group living tends to provide more protection
	Communal care of young
	Efficient feeding
	Protection from predators
	Increased competition
	Risk of disease

**Dominance hierarchies** - some members of a population have higher priority to access than others (honey bee)
*Altruistic behavior* means sacrificing an individuals own fitness for others
	Often seen with kin and close relatives
	Haplodiploidy causes close resemblance between organisms (Moreso than even siblings)
	e.g. vampire bat regurgitation
	Darwinism - conflict as this focuses more on the individual rather than the altruistic collective
	**Hamilton's rule** - if altruistic behavior allows the relatives to produce more offspring that the offspring on their own, altruism can spread
## Thought Cabinet
Operant conditioning - learned
Defensive behavior - instinctive
Reproductive behavior - instinctive

Neurology and genetics -> behavior

Songs in songbirds both learned and intrinsic

Migration a thing because of
	Mating opportunity
	Reduced competition
	Seasonal environments may be more beneficial
	
Migration carries **risk**

Monarch butterfly as a case study
	Specific migration pattern
	High visibility
	Specific egg laying pattern (milkweed)

Tail wagging in dogs vs. cats...

"Eggs expensive, sperm is cheap"

Social behavior, mating dances (have **risk** - behaviors lead to mating and genetic successsion)

*Degree of relatedness* - the more related you are to someone, the more risk you are willing to take for another organism
