#### 23.1 - The Fossil Record
While *Microevolution* (See [[Chapter 21 - Microevolution and Genetic Changes within Populations]]) is the change in allele frequencies within a single population, ***Macroevolution*** is the evolution from one species to another over a much larger time scale

Fossil records are stored in *strata* (or layers) of rock. Every fossil in the same strata was present at roughly the same time. 
*Radiometric Dating*, comparing the levels of carbon isotopes (C14 and C12) with their half lives

***Macroevolution*** depends on the organism your looking at - their life histories, generation time, etc.

If an organism doesn't have a skeleton, we cannot see a fossil of it
There are limitations in knowing the outward appearance of the organism
You must determine the location of the organism when it had died (which doesn't necessarily line up with where it is discovered)
#### 23.2 - Earth History
What the globe has looked like has changed over years of continental drift, according to the theory of *plate tectonics*
This changed where organisms lived, and thus, where their fossils were found
Random natural events (volcanos, asteroids, etc.) also cause mass extinctions(>50% species death) )or otherwise change organism behavior and earth history
#### 23.3 - Historical Biogeography and Convergent Biotas
Two types of organismal distribution:
	*Continuous Distribution*: organisms occupy a continuous, uninterrupted, and consistent pattern of distribution
	**Disjunct Distribution**: organisms occupy distinct, disjunct, and spotted patterns of distribution
		Usually a result of *dispersion* - when organisms move away from an original population to a new population (organismal) - and *vicariance* - when habitats fragment (environmental)

*Analogous structures* (e.g. flight across insects, bats, brids, etc.) as a result of **Convergent Evolution** - the evolution of similar traits across different organisms

Biotas - the collection of all organisms within a given region (fauna, flora, bacteria, etc.)
Biogeographical realms defined by differences in biotas
Continuities in biotas demonstrate 11 historical **zoogeographical realms**

Nearctic
Panamanian
Neotropical
Palearctic
Saharo-Arabian
Afrotropical
Sino-Japanese
Oriental
Madagascan
Oceanian
Australian

*Endemic species* are those that occur nowhere else on earth other than in their habitats
#### 23.4 - The History of Biodiversity
Adaptive radiation occurs when organisms that are closely related develop different [[Adaption]]s
	E.g. [[Geospiza]]
	Usually occurs quite quickly and as a result of an empty niche space (low competition)
	These organisms occupy generally different *adaptive zones*
#### 23.5 - Interpreting Evolutionary Line
Understanding when mass extinctions occur, what evolutionary pressures effect organisms in a given *strata*, etc.

#### 23.6 - The Evolution of Morphological Novelties
Phenotypic evolution over long time scales:
	*Phyletic Gradualism* - species change goes slowly and steadily
	**Punctuated Equilibrium** - species remain relatively unchanged with bursts of evolutionary action
		E.g. a bottle neck event

Morphological Novelties:
**Allometric growth** - Differential growth in organisms
	E.g. human's heads grow slower than their bodies
	Fiddler crab right claw grows faster than the rest of its body (for intimidation - sexual selection - warding off predators)
	A tradeoff between beneficial and niche filling properties and drawbacks in other categories (think: the cost of color in evolution)
**Heterochrony** - An organisms premature movement into organismal adulthood
	E.g. tadpole hatching speeds up when other eggs are being threatened/there are environmental pressures at play

***Evo-Devo***:
	PAX6 gene, when turned on, codes for development in an eye
		So, if it is turned off, a severely malformed eye forms
	Genes are recycled often times:
		Hair plays a thermoregulatory and then UV protection role
		Sweat glands were repurposed and resulted in salivary and tear duct glands
		Pigment genes worked socially -> UV protection as well as camaflauge
		
## Thought Cabinet
Earth is ~*4.5 billion* y/o
Birds are a lineage of dinosaurs
	Earliest known bird, [[Archaeopteryx]], emerged 150 million years ago
	Feathers first evolved (presumably) as being selected for temperature retention (*Thermoregulation*), **social display** (e.g. sexual selection), then gliding, and then flight over millions of years. 
	We have a transitional fossil of them that still have beaks, bipedal structure, and feathers, though no flight function like with most modern birds.

Why are all birds bipedal?
