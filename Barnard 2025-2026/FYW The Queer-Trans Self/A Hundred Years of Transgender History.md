### Regulating Sexuality and Gender
#history #queer
*1840's - dresses as a form of bondage* according to one Amelia Bloomer
	pants determined to be morally superior
*1850's - cross-dressing ban* (state by state) that made it illegal "to appear in public in a dress not belonging to his or her sex"
	a moral issue, equated to public indecency (treated as misdemeanor)
The development of major industrial cities (with the 1st and 2nd [[Industrial Revolution]]s) allowed more people to leave their small rural, often isolated (heavily religious and nuclear) lifestyles and experiment or adopt a new self
	Queerness in men was a lot more openly expressed, as men had, more often than not, the opportunity to leave the house and go out into the city (where the people are) due to work
		Meanwhile, women traditionally would stay at the house... at least until the...
*1919 - women's right to vote* 
*1920's - lesbianism explodes* due to an exponential, unprecedented growth in women's rights (voting, legislative, social, sexual, etc...)

"cross-dressing" and derivations of it were found in cases even in the civil war, with one notable case of a woman (Loreta Janeta Velazquez)  as a man and donning the moniker "Harry Buford" to join the confederate army

The prevailing **view of homosexuality at the time** was of "gender inversion" 
	Men acting like women or vice verse rather than a distinct thing we would think of as "sexuality"

### The Social Power of Medicine
Medicine doesn't only have functions as a technology, but also a tool used for social change (often for the worse e.g. frenology)
Transgender-ism often medicalized even though it is viewed through a social lens (as gender is socially constructed)
	Think *dysphoria*, often treated as a mental illness or even sickness
	Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, as Austrian writer in the *1860*'s, published a book titled *Researches on the Riddle of "Man-Manly" Love* - outlining the existence of gender "urnings" (a similar concept to dysphoria) described as "female soul enclosed within a male body"
The term "homosexual" coined in *1869* by Karl Maria Kertbeny
Both Kertbeny and Ulrichs saw these homosexual feelings as having a basis in medicine (as both were apparently physical and obtained at birth)
Transgenderism as a medical "***problem***" (implies a need to be solved/remmedied)
Researcher Richard von Krafft-Eving, in his *Psychopathia Sexualis* recognized "antipathic sexual instinct" (or proto-asexuality) as well as various forms and types of gender/sex change and desire... many other researches popped up proposing similar ideas...
*1910 - the term transvestite* coined by **Magnus Hirschfeld**

### An Early Advocate
"variations in sexuality and gender expression are rooted in biology" - what **Hirschfeld** believed, generally
	developed the Scientific Humanitarian Committee - a group devoted to social reform for sexual minorities
	a founding member of **Freud's** Vienna Psychoanalytic Society
	Became part of the World League for Sexual Reform
Morphological effects of sex hormones testosterone and estrogen began to be studied in as early as the 1910's
Earliest documented MTF genital transformation surgery in *1931*
**Hirschfeld** had to flee Germany (as a socialist and homosexual) due to Nazi's taking power
	His personal library was burned as he fled to the French Riviera
Earl Lind - self described "androgyne" - (aka. Jennie June) wrote the *Autobiography of an Androgyne* 
### Midcentury Transgender Social Networks
*California Sex Deviates Research Act of 1950* - goal was to find the causes and curses of homosexuality (castrating male sex offenders in California prisons to change hormone levels)
*1940s -* **Karl Bowman**, San Francisco researcher, reported how people would desire to get hysterectomies, hormone treatments, and genital reassignment surgeries 
**Louise Lawrence** (trans woman) started constructing a social network of "crossdressers" or other trans people and began having public lectures to Bowman and co.
	Helped people get access to medical and surgical gender care
*1949* - controversy arises in which governor-to-be Pat Brown says that willingly doing surgery on healthy skin was "mayhem" 
	only a few sex reassignment surgeries followed
also *1949* - Christine Jorgenson gets successful sex-reassignment surgery in Copenhagen
	likely blew up in popularity thanks to rising doubts in the understanding of what it means to be a man or woman after WWII (jobs sectors were completely revolutionized... new technologies were spawning)
	needed "as much good publicity as possible for the sake of all those to whom I am a representation of themselves"
	Distinction between travestide (dressing) vs. transexual (sex) outlined thanks to contrast between Virginia Prince and Christine Jorgenson, respectively
		Distinction further between the two and homosexuality (and intersexuality)
Harry Benjamin was the medical practitioner who worked with LL and KB, also met with **Hirschfeld** in Germany (which is how he got into the gender reassignment surgery business)
**Virginia Prince** worked with LL, first to have founded organization devoted to transgender concerns in U.S - *1968* was living as a woman full-time (same year as the Columbia gym/Vietnam protests)
	in *1952*, published the newsletter "***Transvestia***: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress"
		potentially first political trans publication in history - put an emphasis on *dress* (i.e. crossdressing, transvestitism, etc.)
### Government Harassment
**Prince** was mail-sexting another trans woman across the country. The US postal service had been already keeping tabs on her far-away lover due to soliciting and receiving obscene material, and prosecuted **Prince** for shipping obscenity (her lesbian sexual fantasies) over mail
	What's at stake, then, is the very concept and sense of self as well as the ways in which we arrange ourselves politically and socially
Lives are often measured and organized via. **utility** in a society and to the state, and so transgender roles disrupt these expectations by rejecting who can/ought to reproduce, join the military, etc.
*1954* - 15% of homosexual men surveyed in prisons were incarcerated simply due to their homosexuality
*1964* - Sanford Atay and Wallace de Ortega fined $25,000 each and sentenced to 40 years in prison for publishing soft-core gay/trans smut (One of the titles was "The Lady Was A Man")
Due to Prince's *Transvestia*, Prince was convicted of felony (though it refrained from including any sexual content at all) and received 5 years probation
### The First Modern Transgender Organizations
**Hose and Heels Club** - *Prince* organized a group of men(?) to come to a hotel room with a brown paper bag (could be seen on the same level as public drinking/intoxication) with heels and stockings. They were instructed to put them all on at the same time to all be implicated in the social crime of cross-dressing together
	Turned into the *Alpha Chapter* (like a sorority) of the **Foundation for Personality Expression** (FPE) - then called the *Society for the Second Self (Tri-Ess)*
		Excluded it to everyone other than Transvestides


## Thought Cabinet
The threat of crossdressing, trans-ness, and other gender "deviancy" is a perceived threat to utility and [[Use-Value]]
[[Capital]] cannot be accrued if the society in which your people exist in does not allow for varying types of expression
