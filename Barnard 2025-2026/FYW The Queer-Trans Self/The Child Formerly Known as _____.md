## Thought Cabinet
Imagery of trains, holes in the self, a distance between what people expect you to be and what you are

What is the hole?
A different identity, an emptiness where your past should be

" youâ€™d rather be her or at least bury her, seal her shut or shut her up"
The speaker themselves is conflicted on how to view themself

There are *2 selves* inside one individual, this is what causes discomfort
	Because our language is so limiting, so singular, such a monoculture of ideas that cannot possibly be indicative of the whole of the experience of life

"Is what your father calls you now" - I resonate with this line. There is introduced a "now," a present, which is incongruent with a "then," the past
The train is where I read this poem, read it tunneling, barreling across the city, its jerky motions, its random jitters, its delays, and all the people that surround you, observing you - "& they all want to see the girl"

"& means he is the kind of man who wants a boy to ruin him. - To carve a hole & move inside. " -> Observing a distinct separation between want and action, we often pursue things that we feel disconnected from, that we don't want

"An image of ourselves inside ourselves" -> there are two selves, as well as the selves of everyone else we ever meet
