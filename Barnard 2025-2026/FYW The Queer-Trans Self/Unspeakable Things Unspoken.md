Analyzing the Afro-American literature canon
	Weirdly labeled as distinct from "American Literature"
	Ought to find a canon of text that isn't solely about suffering and that highlights the creativity of black Americans
Race invented, and in 1900's academia as black people "discovered they had shaped or become a culturally formed race, and that it had specific and revered difference, suddenly they were told there is no such thing as “race,” biological or cultural, that matters and that genuinely intellectual exchange cannot accommodate it"

Our novelists don’t discover cultural values within themselves; they invent them.

Origins of "European civilization" line arbitrarily drawn at Greece (and not further back, towards Egypt)

Divided into four misinterpretations/"arguments"
1. Afro-American art doesn't exist (it clearly does and has influenced thought, even is a part of the "European Canon")
2. Afro-American art exists, but is inferior (seen mostly as emotional, irrational, naturalistic, yet inferior)
3. Afro-American art exists, but is superior only when it measures up to the universal criteria of Western art (must follow what everyone is used to, what everyone expects from European art)
4. Afro-American art is only worthy insofar as it is as raw, rich ore. That is, it must be refined by European intellectuals to have any real value

Morrison proposes that we need either
	A theory of literature that can include Afro-American literature
	A reexamination of the American canon to include Afro-American literature

African-American literature, in a way, has been shadowed, talked over, hidden. Rediscovering it means investigating when voices weren't heard, when there is a seemingly clear canon (Romanticism, Modernism, etc.)

You can look to texts made by white people to see how people of color were perceived, both artistically and societally

Like Ahab to his white whale, victim to racist, forever changed and changer

Reinterpreting the established canon through a black lens

There is a clear flight from blackness in a great deal of Afro - American litera - ture. In others there is the duel with blackness, and in some cases, as they say, “You’d never know.”

Using language familiar, meaningful to one's childhood
	A matter of leaning into and defining expectations

A matter of balancing and reconciling black culture while trying to publish a book in a white mainstream

Simple words, hidden and complex meaning

Shows how much thought is put into every word pf a text
