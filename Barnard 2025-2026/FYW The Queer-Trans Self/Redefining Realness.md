*On: writing oneself as trans and how language influences us*


#### Chapter One
It's difficult to write about the "un-trans" self in the past (need to use he or just use the name) versus the present, trans self (using she)
	There is a discrepancy, a distance (even though its the same self)

There's always an implied distance between the two sexes, the two genders:
	In kindergarten with the separated cubbies
	Divided into two lines
	Two colors
	Separate toys (dolls v. action figures)
	With separated wardrobes
	Separated parents
	Separated by siblings
		Its about sorting and organizing people

**Flower and scent imagery** (traditionally and stereotypically associated with femininity):
	On the dress that young Janet grabbed
	Wicker seat in the living room
	The botanical garden and the flower girls to her parent's wedding
	In "perfumed visions" of photos with her mother 
	Smells of food, nature, and perfume from the women she grew up around

The very same things that made her father masculine (strength, fear of punishment, safety) - ("strong, dutiful, outspoken"s) was what made her grandmother, feminine.

Expression and Identity are inextricably linked with experience, environment, race, relationships, etc.

#### Chapter Six
*Keisha* represents the false identity, the distance felt, of wanting to know the self but never being able to
The masculine represented as smelling "unclean..." as something that is covered up or removed, but always comes back
	Like my experience with shaving
Hair often the first way trans women able to express themselves

Discusses acceptance and expression under the face of repression - invisible laws that dictate our every move
About love and sexuality

#### Chapter Eight
Cultures that expand the western gender-binary:
*Mahu* (Kanaka Maoli) - indigenous Hawaiian cultural identity used to describe those who differ from western understandings of gender

Wendi acts as (now) **Mary's** Vergil
Finding community, "passing" and clockability, hormone care and fitting n, "realness," being called "sissy" vs. not caring about what others think
