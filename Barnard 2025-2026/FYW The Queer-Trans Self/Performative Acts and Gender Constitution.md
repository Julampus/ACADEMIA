By [[Judith Butler]]
#philosophy #queer #essay 

**Key Ideas**
Provides an extension of [[Speech Act]] - the concept of [[Performative (Butler)]] actions (see link for definition)
	A fine example of [[Phenomenology]]

How to describe "doing" without any of the moral implications - *action theory*
+
Social agents (language, gesture, symbol...) constitute social reality

## Main Text
Quotes [[Simone De Beauvoir]] - "one is not born, but, rather, becomes a woman" (honey, i know)

Gender is dependent on (and in flux with) *time*

Gender is a socio-historical situation rather than a natural fact

A body is not just a static mechanism performing actions, but a vessel that is acted upon and a tuning fork on others', while also forging and contributing to social potentialities

Sex as the physical and socially meaningless, while gender is the socially flux (as paraphrased from Beauvoir)

[The various acts of gender create the idea of gender]

The body become the gendered body through a series of gender-ifying acts over time, yet those acts also change in meaning thanks to differing variations of expression of these acts
	Like social-natural selection of which acts go to gender and which don't
	To continue the metaphor, eventual speciation, determined in part by the environment and in part by surrounding populations (other genders), occurs over time
	Or more mathematically, the limit of the product of these gendered acts converges to man and women, masculine and feminine

Being a woman is not only a matter of facing oppression, Butler says

Bodies and society

Incest taboo -> Heteronormativity
	Can't talk about gender without talking about sexuality, ig.

If there exist biological sexes, than heterosexual dispositions can be argues for a lot more easily
Gender is only real because people perform gender - it was naturally-socially selected due to its replicability (gender breeds more gendered selves)

Gender is NOT a necessity of [[Ontology]]
## Thought Cabinet
Notably, they are not saying that gender is pretend or just a performance
	Rather, that the social context and our understanding of each other is dependent on the acts in which we conduct
	That is, the way we act changes how we are acted upon
	Notably **through time**

A "play" or "theatrical" theory implies that there already exists a gender. Rather, as with the extension of [[Speech Act]], doing the gender CHANGES the gender
	Remember, through *time*

"My suggestion is that the body becomes its gender through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through"
