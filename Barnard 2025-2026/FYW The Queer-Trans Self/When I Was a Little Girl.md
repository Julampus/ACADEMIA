From [[When I Was a Little Girl - Gomes.pdf]]
By **Lena-Nsomeka Gomes**

Recounts a story from the author's elementary school days when her romantic desires towards her teacher were suppressed, and yet ultimately caused more harm.
	"Although I knew we could never be lovers, I took comfort in knowing that she loved me"
Recalled taking her father's clothes, mimicking his mannerisms, and trying to be him.
	"The only way I could ever love a woman was to become a man"
*Age 13*
Would call random numbers from the phone book just to get the opportunity to talk to women - pretended to be a man (had a low voice)
	Minutes turn to hours...
	She chose the name **Tito**
	"I never even thought it was necessary to question my sexuality; I was beyond sex. I was transformed, transfixed. I had met the waves and I was riding high on pure innocence."
Used a photo of her cousin to "put a name to the face"
	Conflict arises when a date with a phone girl is planned - stops calling

*Age 15*
Her cousin Anna ("always preaching about socialism and black politics) gives her a book about sexuality, calls her a lesbian
Her mother than tries to pull her from the closet (to put a label to the feelings) -> "I'm not gay. I'm not a TV character! I'm real!"

"Later, everyone had a name for me... But I remember the innocent years, when my love for women had no name"

### Thought Cabinet
A story about living without labels, seemingly outside the confines of sex and gender, though consistently being jettisoned back into a reality where sexuality and gender are an imperative. That is, trying to live as in individual in a world where we are constantly collectivised.
