*The Radical Potential of Queer Politics?*
By Cathy J. Cohen
From [[CathyCohen.pdf]]

## Main Text
Rather than integration into a system, a revolutionary new system is proposed to be implemented
Your relation to power (not only your identity) determines how you practice queer politics
Queer politics often reinforces dichotomies of heterosexual vs. everything else
#### Emergence of Queer Politics and a New Politics of Transformation
Queer theory centered around deconstructing heterogendered views of the world and organizations of power

Queer politics - a reaction to the "degaying" of activism (particularly during AIDS activism) to avoid assimilationist tendencies
	Tends to occur through highlighting their own non-normativity

An interesting thing... the deconstruction of ones identity as a social construction while advocating for the construction of social protections
Queer politics perceived as the *opposition*, the *contrast*, the *foil*
The reinforcement of the dichotomy between heterosexual and queer means that *queer politics* fails to pose a strong enough, destabilizing force
The term **queer** doesn't incapsulate the varying intersectional identities (class, race, etc.) that might make one "queer" relationship different from another

Differing sexualities (from heterosexuality) didn't have the material, moral basis of procreation (in most cases) and were thus deemed hedonistic

*Intersectionality* in terms of targeting racial, economic, sexual, and socially oppression (just to name a few) are stronger than those that just aim to target one

#### The Root of Queer Politics: Challenging Heteronormativity
Heteronormativity must be shattered for any semblance of incorporation into society - incorporation not through assimilation, but through revolution
"Everyone does [oppression] to queers" - I Hate Straights manifesto distributed at pride parades in NYC and Chicago in the 90's
Queer *Mall Invasions* concede to a consumer world, though disrupt it to some degree
#### Heterosexuals on the (Out)side of Heteronormativity)
Heteronormativity has its roots in white supremacy
	Black people were said to have no conception of family and thus couldn't marry

We don't need to get rid of labels and community, but in the creation of spaces for remaking our identities
