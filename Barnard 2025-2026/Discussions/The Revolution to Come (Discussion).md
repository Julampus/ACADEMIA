## The Revolution to Come:
***A history of an Idea from Thucydides to Lenin**
Part of the Long Shadow of The Enlightenment Series*

Of the same name as the book by *Dan Edelstein*

"Revolution as the benefactor of humanity"

Dan Edelstein, Joanna Stalnaker, Daniel Luban

### Opening from Edelstein
The position of the French Revolution as the "turning point of modernity"
	Fades after the bicentennial... not so much a pillar of modernity anymore 
	[Why is it that the French Revolution centers modern global history?]
	Cold war potentially changed the way we think about the revolution
	"Revolution from a fact to an act"
		The subject of the revolutionary emerged (the word didn't exist in English prior)
French vs. American Enlightenment
Revolution, in the public mind, goes from a detriment to a catalyst for positive social change
	"Its always more or less the same" - Observe the world for 40 or 400 years - [[Marcus Aurelius]] ->
	Change may be possible
### Comments from Luban
**Premodern vs. Modern Revolution (1789 and afterwards)**
##### Premodern Revolution
"Stop the cycle of historical change"... history repeating itself
*Polabian synthesis* defined Premodern (Polybius)
	There will inevitably be different beliefs
American revolution the last of the premodern revolutions
##### Modern Revolution
Rejected the *Polabian synthesis*
Rejects that "Modern revolutions a result of religious apocalyptic action"
	Instead, revolution tied to societal progression (towards a single "end point")
		[[Accelerationism]] potentially follows
		Seemingly anti-pluralist
An example of the quintessential modern revolutionary text: [[Communist Manifesto]]
A reason for the change from pre to post modern... material (Metaphysical) changes prompted by Rousseau...
### First Response from Edelstein
Progress manifested as empirical -> Potentially could be interpreted through a more historically dualistic view (a. la. Dewey; as Luban posited)
"We are Moderns living in a built built by Ancients"
	They were designed with a different theory of history (science, mind, etc.)
Modern forms of governance (often fail) - We are built upon the structures of history
### Comments from Stalnaker
*Where the discussion completely turned*
Who's ideas matter/win/are retained throughout history
No women included as revolutionaries (only oppressive rulers; "no woman thinkers") 
	DAMN called him out
	Why this absence matters...
Both this idea of progress and this view of revolution are ant-pluralist 
	Anti-pluralism is why revolutions have been much more violent
	"Everyone will like strawberries and cream once the revolution comes" - a. la. the cover of the book
Some uncommon characters from the enlightenment era handles with grace and strong overview
	Rousseau treated as an ancient
	Human instinct is subject to change, as Rousseau posited (potentially not as much of an anti-revolutionary as Edelstein suggested)
	
Emelie duChatlier - strong enlightenment thinker (before Voltaire)
	Her conception of revolution was *Pluralist* (in contrast with what Edelstein had argued of the Enlightenment)
	Each person must pursue their own reasoning - proposed by [[Emanuel Kant]] decades later
	
What does the erasure of women change from Edelstein's account?
A seemingly "profoundly pessimistic book"

"Veil of modernity" and the impact of Europe on the rest of the world looms
### Second Response from Edelstein
Voltaire writes that revolutions are driven by death...
Technological developments transformed what was perceived to be possible
	Changed thinkers from being more modest to more relatively imaginative
What duChatlier proposed might still be lingering to the "Ancients"
	Voltaire commissioned himself to appear as a roman senator via. sculpture -> Remnants of the Ancients' thoughts
### Questions Thereafter
From the moderator -> The influence of media revolutions on material revolutions 
Public opinion converges around a single point - an anti-pluralist French Enlightenment
	Why exonerate the philosophes, the public
		Conceptual problems within what they said
		
Why are women not mentioned?
	Because he focused on modern political thinkers <u>in power</u>
	The enlightenment era French canon...
	
Socio-cultural stressors can often spark revolution (e.g. Woman's life movement in Iran)

Why end with Lenin?
	Ends with the death of Lenin, how death of a revolutionary affects the revolution
	Would be a whole another book

What about far-right extremist revolutions?
	An appropriation of the term?
	A merging of a very different political tradition to progress-focused revolutions
	An ignorance more so out of expediency?
	Less of a family revolution across the terms, very different types (though still revolution?)
Are we living through revolutionary template?
	There is *stasis* - fighting in the streets to revolution
	And *metabole* - regime change
	Are combined to create the term revolution, though sometimes there is metabole without the stasis
There are Liberal revolutions (1830, 1848) -> pluralistic revolutions
	These revolutions faltered
		Branched out to either authoritarianism or socialism (To Bonaparte or to Lenin)
How does consumerism affect the revolutions at hand
	the nobility and proletariat class divide
Russian revolution a misnomer (Trotsky and Stalin weren't ethnically Russian)
## Thought Cabinet
Was also discussion of the Iranian [Green Revolution], of the "twitter revolution"
Arab spring, Algerian hurac, 1989 eastern European revolutions
Rule of the one, rule of the few, rule of the many, or a combination

Ancient pluralism vs Modern monism

Revolutions crave a "Red Leviathan" (Stalin, Mao, Trump(?))
